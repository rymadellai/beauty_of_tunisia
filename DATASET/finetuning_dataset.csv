Tunisia,best beaches,Best beaches in Tunisia + Not too crowded,"Hi guys,

I'm familiar with Mahdia and I really love the beaches in there. But I'm looking to try out other places. 

I don't want sousse / hammemet / very touristy and crowded places

But rather something less hype, underrated, more modest moods, but excellent beach and water and nature possibly 😁

Any idea?

Tunisia,best beaches,Instagram is ruining our mental health and self perception,"I can easily say that I have developed some sort of addiction to Instagram, I spend about 4/5 hours a day doom-scrolling and messaging my friends. It especially got terrible this summer. It started to feel like a competition. Everyone, common people and influencers and celebrities alike, posting their amazing vocations, from one European country to another, from one beautiful beach to restaurants to clubs. Even the people in Tunisia are doing this and posting beaches/clubs/etc… It started to seem to me that it was some sort of competition, who is having the best summer? Everyone is showing off, everyone is having the time of their lives.  I am not sure if people are self-aware when they do this, and I find myself participating in this doomed ritual as well, until my mental health declined because of it and I had to delete the app all together. what are your thoughts on this?

Tunisia,best beaches,First time visiting Tunisia tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice?,"So tomorrow I’ll be travelling to Tunisia for the first time from Ireland. I have wanted to visit for a few years now but here I am. I’m staying in Hammamet on a beach hotel. Is there anything to be aware of in terms of scams and safety regarding food etc? 

In terms of money, the Tunisian Dinar is a closed currency so is it best to get some at the airport when I arrive along with a SIM card? I have also been made aware of beach vendors trying to sell you stuff on the beach. Is there any way to avoid this/make them ignore you? Is it similar to Egypt/Türkiye in terms of pushy vendors where they just leave you alone if you ignore/don’t acknowledge them? 

As I said I’m seriously excited about visiting this country. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

","When shopping for souvenirs from souvenir shops without listed prices, I recommend ‘just looking’ first. 
If you see something you like, the shop keeper will notice and throw up a price. Just continue to say you are just looking and if you start to leave, they will start rapidly dropping the price.

Tunisia,best beaches,i love how you support a foreign cause and you're watching your country drowning,"Palestine has the biggest influence on the region culturally,has the potential to be the most visited country if freed,  it has  Haifa beaches and Holy Aqsa Mosque,it has incredible agriculture similar to Tunisia, they have the best fighters and guerilla factions '(Hamas,Jihad ext..) with Massive ally like Iran

meanwhile, our country will be totally vanished historically because of the history Blackwashing we are the poorest country in north Africa, very weak army, we have no air defense or jets or radars,we're flooded with sub saharians colonizers,**i think we should worry more about our TUNISIA**,Palestine will never be down as long as Syria, Iran proxies are still there, **even Abu Obeida told you either Act or stop saying bullshits for moral support**

Please either be an authentic Tunisian or go find your true identity,western people are protesting because they know that if genocide continues, terrorism will hit them HARD in their own countries, that's their own defense mechanism to say ""dont target us,its our gov fault""

wake up kids and Immature adults,Tunisia should be powerful to protect itself from the future,if palestine will be free and these factions are still there and they becomes like Hezbollah,a major regional war will break out between Saudis and Iranians,its like Algerian-Morrocan situation but much much violent than you think,the middle east will never be calm

Tunisia,best beaches,Tips and questions for visiting Tunisia. ,"Firstly I appreciate this must get asked a lot so thank you for taking the time. Myself and my family are booked to visit Tunisia next June and I have some questions regarding visiting Tunisia that I'd appreciate help on.

Firstly I'm not dumb enough and naive enough to ask is Tunisia safe, like most cities I am traveled to I am sure it is fine you just need to be sensible.

Whilst a lot of our time will be taken in the resort it would be rather silly of me to not explore and experience the rich and vibrant history that Tunisia has to offer, with that in mind I also want to be respectful of local customs and practices and as such have a few questions. For clarification were visiting a resort in Monastir towards the Sousse end.

1. Food, I am a food lover and when visiting other countries I try to explore the local cuisine, I don't mean the ""local"" dishes they serve tourists in many resorts but I mean truly authentic local dishes. For me sea food is my passion and being on the coast I imagine the city has some amazing sea food places. With that in mind I would love your recommendation on both dishes to try and maybe even restaurant in the area.
2. When traveling the city and exploring. Am I best to hire a local guide for the day? Or explore myself, any must visit places? We plan to take a tour of Amphitheater of El Jem but any other attraction that you would say is a must? I have heard the mosques are beautiful but do they welcome visitors? I don't wish to be disrespectful and want to be as polite as possible.
3. Language and local customs. This is important to me, I appreciate the main language of Tunisia is Arabic with French being quite common, how common is English? Also any recommendeded phrases or sayings you'd suggest I learn to help communicate? I am a firm believer that as the visitor it is my duty to try to learn your language and customs and not expect the locals to cater for me. That said, I also wish to be respectful of customs and local traditions. Can anyone suggest areas or customs I should observe to be respectful, I know in some Muslim countries women should have their hair covered, outside of the resort would it be polite for my wife to do this with a scarf, or is it generally accepted that tourists wouldn't?
4.  And finally, currency and any other tips? I understand the Dinar is a closed currency and I need to get my Dinar there, I can't also take it out of the country, any tips for this? (Although I may be best asking on a travel group for this) And finally. Anything else you can suggest or tips you can give.

Thank you for taking the time and I am excited to visit your country. (And I don't just mean the holiday resort/beach)",No top comment,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fu2k6i/tips_and_questions_for_visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir",General,en
Tunisia,best beaches,What is your favourite thing about Tunisia?,"Considering so many posts here are negative I thought we should have a celebration of the things we do like about our country. For all its faults Tunisia is truly one of the most diverse, naturally beautiful places on earth with a rich history and amazing culture. Having said that I would say my favourite thing is definitely the landscape and attractions, we have desert, snow, mountains, plains, ocean, islands and urban areas, and on top of that we have some of the best historical landmarks in the world representing our Roman, Phoenician, Imazighen and Arab identity (think el djem, dougga, traditional dwellings in Matmata, Carthage, Kairouan, Kerkuane), we have 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, we are a tiny country compared to our neighbours with a small population yet we produce so many famous international musicians, some huge names in football and other sports, we successfully evicted one of the world's strongest ever empires from our land, toppled a dictatorship, most people speak minimum 3 fuckin languages and to be honest I think we are the most underrated country in the world. 

I love Tunisia, we have a lot of problems that need addressing but negativity breeds negativity and I know a lot of us are sick of only hearing the bad things. 

What is your favourite thing about Tunisia?

But these last couple of years I lost interest in doing activities during Summer. I Cannot SUPPORT the heat anymore to the point where asking me to go outside on a midday to the beach is considered as an insult.


I have high light sensitivity, it's very hard to open my eyes when exposed to bright light it's an uncomfortable experience, and I feel like my skin is on fire.

And most places have become crowded and more littered.

Tunisia,best beaches,I am planning a trip to Tunisia and need some help about it :),"Hello! 
I am planning a trip to a beautiful country Tunisia this September for a week, will be going by a taxi from Algeria. I am thinking about visiting 2-3 cities, Tabarka, Tunis and maybe something else, but I am not sure yet. So, my questions are:

1) What are the best snorkeling spots in Tunisia? Considering the fact that I’ll be heading from Algeria, it would be the best if maybe some of the spots will be nearby from it. 
2) Also would like to know about scuba diving spots. Heard that there is a good one in Tabarka, but not sure about that. 
3) Is there a good beaches in Tabarka?
4) I want to go from Tabarka to Tunis by a bus (or a train), is this possible, how can I do that and how much will the ticket cost? 
5) Also in my journey between Tabarka and Tunis I would love to visit cap Angela. How can I do that? Is there a bus between this 2 destinations? 

Thank you for all your help and information! Have a good day!","2. I am a scuba diving instructor and in my opinion, the best scuba diving in Tunisia is in Tabarka. You can go to the port and look at the signs for which company to go with, or find one on Facebook.

4. You can take a louage (like a mini bus) between the two— I dont know exactly how much it costs but maybe between 20 and 30 dinar? Someone else might have a better idea.

Tunisia,best beaches,I need new friends!,"Well, here we go; I recently moved to Tunis (La Marsa, to be specific), and I'm having a really, REALLY hard time making friends here. I can hold a friend, but the first step is the hardest to me, I'm afraid that if the approach is weird then that person is just gonna laugh at me xD. So after 6-ich months of failures, I decided to try Reddit. It seems like an excellent place to find people with comparable mindsets who can eventually become friends.

So a little bit about me, I 26M, and I like a couple of things; these are in no particular order; I like books, I really do like books, I just started Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing by Matthew Perry, and I'm actually in love, you see, I love friends, I watched it like 50 times already and I'm never gonna get bored doing that, and actually having reading a book written by that character, talking about the shit he went through and how he actually lived his life away from the lights is just INSPIRING.

I like conversations. I like being on the same bandwidth with somebody that our conversations end with either learning new info, laughing our asses off, or just having a silly convo for the sake of just having a convo. I also like debates, I really love having different ideas with someone and debating those ideas until either one of us is convinced or just reaching an end point. ( If we ever meet, and we start a debate, GOOD LUCK GETTING OUT OF THERE xD)

I like long walks, and that's actually what I've been doing for the last 6-ich months. I've been taking walks after work, really long walks, on the beach, in the forest, on the road, wherever it is, I just like walking, and combining it with a convo would make the best of it.

I like learning new facts about history, space, tech, economics, arts, etc. actually any topic you have in mind, I don't mind. I just love listening to people talk about what they love, that shine in their eyes just gives me joy.

I like smoking (jouet), I might be addicted, but I actually don't give a damn, I'm happy. (If you already smoke, combine that with a great book and thank me later)

Yeah! So that's over all who I am, if you see something that interests you, don't hesitate to drop a comment or just shoot me a DM and let's talk.

**PS: I REALLY don't give a damn wether you're a male, female or any other shit, it's really up to the convo we'll have so please no comments about that, if you're not interested just skip the post. THANK YOU.**

Tunisia,best beaches,"I still don't quite understand what's *so* bad about Tunisia, so help me please","I grew up in Monastir and moved to Germany at 18 cause I am half-German and wanted to explore my other home. I fucking hate it. After 4 years here, I am seriously considering moving back to good ole Mestir. First off, I have to admit that we're relatively wealthy there, but not rich, maybe top 20%. I am not even alone, one of my best friends there is half-French but refuses to move to France and instead studies and works in Tunisia. I am very patriotic and I always wanted to help fix Tunisia but at this point I don't know \*what\* to fix.

The one huge advantage in Europe is the better pay of course, but they also just work much much more here. Starting as early as elementary school where they only get 6 weeks of summer vacation. Most of what they talk about is wörk, and they focus on it their entire lives, streets here are completely deserted by 10pm even in a big city. Really the only fun they have is in the few weeks of vacation. Truth is, Tunisians are very lazy compared to the rest of the world (based). In Tunisia, there's always someone to socialize with cause people are friendlier and not as busy, our nature is much more fun. Great beaches with very clear water, non-depressing climate... Our food is SO much better like you wouldn't believe (they actually consider McDonald's a good meal here lol). My point is, they don't actually get to enjoy their wealth and just end up spending it on more expensive cars or bikes or mattresses or whatever, basically stuff we also have but more expensive. Would that make you happier though?

Another big complaint I often hear is that Tunisia makes entrepreneurship very hard along with many many many other political problems. I think that's true but you'll be just as disappointed in nearly every other country. Germans for example pay more than half of their income to the state (income tax, vat, diwana, various small fees, etc.) but just never complain :\^). Literally some laws here would cause a rebellion in Tunisia. You only have to look at Reddit's front page to see how corrupt American politics is.

The only thing that really pissed me off about Tunisia was the trash problem. 7atta ki nimchi n3oum nal9a 100+ canet celtia fil 93ar, 3leh haka :(( ? Also the typical tkoulif, Tunisians should mind their own business a bit more imo

Maybe it's just Monastir, maybe I am extremely privileged without knowing, or maybe I have other priorities, but I just don't get you guys. Also maybe suggest a better place, only one that comes to my mind is Switzerland, but that's just another league.","Its true that germans pay a lot to the state, but on the other hand the state gives a lot back to the people.

You have no income, you get housing a'd money from the state.

You are ill and cant work?  you salary will still be paid for a very long time

You have a sickness? The med care will pay up to 1 million euros / year to save you.

There are many other things, like public parcs or places for children to play etc.

It would be really a long list.

In Tunisia the state also takes a big chunk of peoples income, but what does he give in return?

I mean to get a better comparison, go life of 800 tnd for 3 months in tunisia and work 180/ hours a month to get them.

Pay rent for an apartment, Transportation, food everything from this 800 tnd.
and keep in mind there are a lot of people that even get less, and have to support a family on top not just themselves.

And after this come back with your comparison.

Also about the lazy part, this might be true for some state jobs, a lot of Tunisians have to work very hatd, often they will work on top of their daytime job, wjerever there is a possibility, because you cannot really live from the ordinary salaries.

Germany has its bad points, its totally true, but for the normal employee, there are a lot of things he won't have to worry about like ever.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wjsue3/i_still_dont_quite_understand_whats_so_bad_about/,"Tunis, Tunis, Monastir",General,en

We want somewhere which will offer nice beaches, have something to do outside of the resort ( I will be exploring the city ) has good places to eat and will just be fun for a family of three, I am looking at all inclusive hotels and Hammamet & Sousse keep popping up.

This will be our first time in Tunisia, we usually travel to Agadir Morocco and have a blast there so a city quite similar would be perfect.","I will personnally recommend Sousse.

Sousse is great for families because it have nice beaches, a lot of family activities( Port El Kantaoui, Medina,...) various restaurants and cultural activities.

Plus Sousse is in the center of many sites and cities: You can easily travel from Sousse to the capital, Monastir, Kairouan, Hammamet, Mahdia, you have a zoo that in my memories was great in Enfidha( Friguiya park), etc.

So it's a good compromise because you can spend a day just in the beach in Sousse and the other day visiting the city, plus you can easily visit another city if you get tired of Sousse.

i am half tunisian living in europe and was in djerba many times.

i was very curious about the refugee situation there. some people i met there  have seen c0rpses on the beach multiple times. still some of them want to leave tunisia.

maybe some of you know a refugee, or you have been one or consider leaving tunisia. i wanted to highlight that situation in a art project and have some questions....

&#x200B;

what exact situations in your life made you or the people you know want to leave the country?

(for example: medical treatment wasnt affordable and it lead to a relative passing away because of that)

what where you carrying in your bag when leaving the country? (example: passport or do you destroy your passport, snacks, photos,..)

where you leaving with a small boat? what where you leaving with?

where you leaving alone or with other people? how many went with you?

what problems arised while on boat/in a car /etc?

have you heard from people who went away ever since?

have you actually lost someone because this person passed away while fleeing? how you found that out?

what was your destination? where were u going from? how long it took you till you arrived your destination?

best regards.","Since i originate from a rather desolate region most of my cousins illegally immigrated (one of them was 14 at the time) luckily none of them died and from my understanding what drove them to do this is for the most part lack of hope and opportunity mixed with the delusion that life in Europe is easy and free of worries which is an image mainly portrayed by media and movies and if you are thinking that opportunities exist but these people fail to see them let me explain why you are wrong in this situation, the region im talking about is ben guarden if you have never been there the best way to explain how things are there it’s basically a place overlooked by the government and local investors to the point where the first national retail company to open its doors there was aziza a COUPLE of years back also there was only around 2-3 factories there and they were closed so when you live somewhere where agriculture its next to impossible and no one want to invest and provide considerable workplace you have three choices in life : 

1- you become a social outcast and focus on your studies so u can move when you’re older (if u think im exaggerating my aunt thought her daughter was mentally unstable because she was spending her time studying instead of blabbering with girls her age)

2- you get into illegal trading (contra) and risk your life in libya

3- you risk your life and illegally immigrate

As for papers they never take any papers with them and usually deny that they are Tunisians in the first place they usually say they are from somewhere with war like Syria ,Iraq… so they dont get sent back .

From what i also heard some of them are actually doing pretty well for them selves at least those with useful skills for example one of my cousins currently works on extending railways because he learnt smithing from his dad and those with no particular skills get help from relatives that are there legally to get underpaid labor jobs.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/upfyxj/personal_questions_about_tunisian_refugees_post/,"Tunis, Djerba, Tunis",General,en

BISMILLAH  
   
Wednesday the 21 th of september 2022  
\-This is an essay ,  
 \-a confession ,  
 \-a quest for urgent emotional support ,  
 \-a recitation of a dramatic childhood burdened with late night gruesome beating and a life in a poor village of   
قُرًى الساحل التونسي الناتن   
\-A paper that describes the holiness of the adolescence crisis and its devastating impact  on relations with opposite gender , stories that haunted my supposed 8 hours of night sleep   
\-I couragely  decided  to write the truth about my 10 years of brain-devasting time  
 spent roughly in a college that gave me after begging a diploma that continuously ruins my life ,   
\-this is a tale of a social revolution ‘s destructive events  ,   
\-a truly honest picture of a one year experience among the “ghorba “ dommar , events that almost catched my breath   
\-and eventually a complete and honest depiction

Of my addiction  situation …  
\-1:  so to start :   
To me : the best thing is to write , to shout , to yell , to say that your problems are real and not that just :   
يفرجها ربي   
Yeah but no , i mean i suffer , i suffocate , dear Almighty have mercy upon me   
To me also : the worst thing is to lose a part of your beloved diary , your ancient  essays , it just gone by the wind , without you noticing it got burned with flames , your papers lost and gone away in   
بلاد العكري   
\*\* ok now may I start this document , thanks for reading respect and love towards your interest in my suffering :   
\*Part one :   
Hey , i was successfully but not asked for BORN in the late 80s  ,   
an epoque of great mouvements , an era of hope and uncertainty ;   
   
God bless my mother and all yours told me that where i was born the hospital ward was infested with cockroaches ,   
i think one of them was smart enough to enter my little developing brain and cruse it deeply that i became an insane , addict , social failure , black hearted   
(قلب أكحل )   
And indifferent   
(ترما أبرد من فريغو )   
Shout out to my infesting little pet …  
So as to say , the first memory of my life was this : i was about 5 years old and it's most likely the year 1993 ,   
The image i remember : we were till now HAMDOULAH a happy group of people with different ages and conceptions living a middle class neighborhood in a village of east coastal tunisia   
(الساحل التونسي )   
This is a family , and may Almighty bless and conserve yours   
We had like a classic house , the type they call   
دار عربي   
It was and still after 3 decades cosey and lovely ….  
So i remember in our yard me and my brother ( shout out bro) bought a plastic soccer ball from one of the oldest stores in town  , the big Nacer GH a pioneer of our little city in the 90’s , may he RIP   
We brought the ball , entered happily our household , but my beloved grand Pa ( father of my PA) was sitting in a corner sipping concentrated RED tea   
التاي ، شاي أحمر تع المرمجيا    
I think that trash is like meth or crack to them old folks lol   
And he was smoking MARS legères , the famous , plus was enjoying some classic arabic music singing throughout the broken radio ..  
We didn't give a damn about grand PA ( may he RIP i still miss him he was a honest man among filthy people …)  
We went crazy AF , kicking the ball harder than Pele towards the wall and shouting crazy like typical middle class tunisian children ….  
Then sadly my memory starts to blaze and I don't recall what happened next OMG  this is  my cockroach pal  did ate that part from my SD card … oh no :’(   
So i dont keep you longer , apparently what happened next was that grand PA got so upset and took our ball and yelled at as ,   
As you can see its a story without meaning or   
عبرة   
But i will ALWAYS be proud that i did remember my first life scenario that is hamdoulah stuck in my vision ,   
I hope you all conserve those first memories of your beautiful childhood …  
\-part 2 : the second event i remember was that ( no body is perfect , i am squeezing my memory part of the brain to try remember that pop song of 1996 that we used to sing ) while playing in a little so called forest in our neighborhood , like i said we lived in a village not that urbanic ,   
So we were climbing trees singing jumping and stealing Almond   
(اللوز )   
We were three happy and back then caring about each other , neighbors and pals ,   
Sadly all that friendship went flying into air for those who got married , those who immigrated , those who became rich , and those who become a proud and honest addict ,   
Those little scams and troubling we did in the hood are still present in my mind , and everytime i happen to remember em i just burst in the last tears that were left on me ,   
But ok , that's life , nothing is permanent , see patriarch Noah…   
\-Part 3 folks then i will spare you my sickness memories :   
It was about 1997 or so , i had an  uncle ( i still don't like it , he is the type of “SFAXIEN “ life style and thinking \[ no offense and big shout out \]   
So this asswipe convinced my little brain to go with him in a swim with his kids who were also my pals ,   
I knew something wasn't' right but i couldn't resist   
So we hop up into his car that his government institution gave him , it was and old Renauld bull crap vehicle ,   
So we arrive at time at one of the most beautiful beach and sea in Green Tunisia , you might guess ..  
The douche was swimming with his kids , its his right , he didnt care bout my ass and didnt even talked to me , why the fuck you brought me  here asshole ? i could have been playing soccer in the hood   
(بطحة الحومة )   
Or watching saturday’s   
ايقاعات عالمية على قناة 21   
\-okeydoke  ,  I left them happily swimming next to the beach and I entered the sea alone to see what it was like ..  
Beware of whats gon happen ,   
I realised that my feets werent touching the sea ground properly , it was my first attempt to learn to swim , i d be a proud “ SAHLI” but fuck i coudnt do it , so i started to drown , and didnt even had the force to cry for help , and the stupid beach didnt have security punkass guard ,   
I knew it , i was gonna die young , 9 years old maybe , so accepting this fate i started to wave and use my hands to stay on top of the water , it lasted bout couple minutes then my hands gave up so i sadly drowned for a couple of seconds and that FILM of your life cassette  started to roll in my mind , but some grateful guy came out of the blue and holded me up , i was mid unconscious  , so sorry i dont remember the details but i was taken back to the beach and rescued in an “ artisanal” way …  
The douche uncle was happy i was still alive and drove us  back home while i was obnubilated ..   
عمر جديد تكتبلي حمدلله    
When i got home i walked straight to my beloved room , my baby room that kept all my secrets inside its walls , and i started to cry , since i ‘v conceived that what happened was the first shock of real life :   
Life doesn't ‘ hold you like a baby ,  
 life is a silent killer ,   
it gave me mental resistant illness(’es!) ,   
i failed college ,  
 i destroyed many lovely relationships,   
i overdosed , i cried in them dark long nights of rainy winter ,  
 i suffered long term virginty and spent millions dinard in drugs and alcohol in order to forget the awefull pain  ,  
 i made my mother proud and then hopeless ,  
 i remember my poor father crying like a baby when he catched my big brother doing his first cigarette ,   
i hamdoullah got graduated , worked my ass hard in my field , i helped and served hundred of people and i do love all people , i no envy no one , i swear Almighty , i have a good heart , but one day i did a suicide attempt that failed but gave me real sequels , but i learned that , after all these years of suffering , problems , abusing , hard work that the most important thing is   
to FIGHT TO STAY ALIVE ….   
Thanks ,   
Sorry for being that emotional i just wanted to share and maybe help or inspire  others with same issues   
\-i certainly will continue the tale if y’all kindly approve and i have time …

Tunisia,best beaches,Visiting Tunisia for a week in May. Recommendations (in particular regarding staying in Sousse)?,"Hello everyone,

I'll be visiting Tunisia in May, landing in Enfidha and departing from Tunis after 8 days. I'm mostly interested in visiting the historical and architectural sites, as well as spending some afternoons and evenings relaxing by the beach or at a bar if weather permits. Since a week isn't too much time, I'll be focusing on Tunis/Carthage/Sidi Bou Said around the capital, and the area around Sousse/Monastir/El Jem/Kairouan further south. 

My current plan would be to book an accommodation for 4-5 nights somewhere in Sousse, and 2-3 nights in Tunis. Sousse appeals to me because as far as I can tell it's got nice beaches and good touristic infrastructure, while also being the main transportation hub in the area which would make it easy to do a bunch of short day trips to the other sites by train or louage (I really rather not rent a car). However, I've also read that it can be quite hectic in the touristic season, but I'm hoping things will still be relatively calm in May (would that be the case?) Alternatively, I've read that Monastir and Mahdia in particular are calmer with even better beaches, but of course with the trade-off not not being as well connected as Sousse.

So, does Sousse sound like it would best suit my needs? If so, what particular areas, beaches, or accommodations would you recommend? It doesn't have to be a standard hotel/resort, as a matter of fact I'd be interested in alternative/unique accommodations that you may be familiar with. Ideally tough I'd like to stay within walking distance to a beach and maybe some restaurants/bars.

Thanks for reading!

Has anyone been in that situation and would like to share their experience? Also how do you even search for a house (i went online but didn't find good websites, any recommendations?)

Tunisia,best beaches,Where to stay in Tunis -- Gammarth vs. La Marsa vs. Sidi Bou Said,"My girlfriend and I will be visiting Tunis and other areas of Northern Tunisia for 2 weeks in August. We are having some trouble deciding where to stay for our portion in (greater) Tunis. Most sources online suggest staying outside of Tunis proper, recommending the northern suburbs instead. Within these northern suburbs, we cannot decide between Gammarth, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. I'm hoping you guys can confirm/deny the impressions I've gathered of each area from my research.

Gammarth seems like it has the best nightlife and underground electronic music (which we are fans of), but most of the hotels and restaurants in the area have bad reviews. Are all of the restaurants in Gammarth bad and catered to tourists? How are the beaches in Gammarth?

Sidi Bou Said looks very beautiful, including the hotels, but it is unclear if there are any bars in the town. Is Sidi Bou Said dry or are there bars/pubs in the area worth going to? 

La Marsa seems to have a good set of restaurants and cocktail bars, and seems relatively walkable (all positives). But, while Gammarth has nightlife and Sidi Bou Said is picturesque, it's unclear if there's anything unique or distinctive about La Marsa. Is this fair? Is La Marsa just a quiet wealthy suburb with a handful of nice places to eat and drink, or is this off base?",No top comment,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/o653kw/where_to_stay_in_tunis_gammarth_vs_la_marsa_vs/,"Tunis, Tunis",Inquiry,en

Just kidding! 

I have traveled to a variety of states within America, and to Canada, so my travel experience is limited - but, I found the Tunisian people to be the most kind people I've ever met. One thing that really stood out to me is how people interact with each other: for example, people in the louage pass money forward - we wouldn't trust one another enough to do that in America. 

It is also amazing how much there is to see in, no offense, such a tiny country. There's so many cool sites, tons of awesome food, the beautiful Mediterranean Sea, et cetera.

Je parle Français alors des vrai locaux sans anglais pas de problème ! Merci 🙏 ","Hello! Welcome to Tunisia, I hope you enjoy your stay!


To have the ""authentic experience"" I advise you to first try the original Tunisian fast food that people casually eat, these are found everywhere across the Medina, and although many of them are good places, there is some better one's.
I advise you to try the Tunisian fast food called Kafteji (made of fried eggs, potato, and other yummy things), you can have it as a plate or as a sandwich, there's a known place called ""Hatab"", unfortunately I do not recall the name of the steeet.


Also, in the ""rue de la Kasba"" there's a good place that sella kafteji and other Tunisian plates you should try it, I forgot the name of the place tho, and right next to it there's a place that makes a Sandwich called Chapati in the Mahdese way.
Also, there's a place called ""Oueld El Hadj"" in ""Bed Jedid"", the way of the Kasbah.
For a fancier experience, there's an excellent place called ""Dar BelHadj"", it's close to the Zaytouna's mosque, you can find it in maps; it offers many Tunisian plates in a fancy building with traditional architecture, a real gem you should try.



Also, in Tunis Downtown, although not Tunisian plate, but an extremely delicious one, in ""rue de Marseilles"" there's a small place called ""chicken house"" it makes Shawarma in indian bread, one of the best things you can try in Tunis.
And never forget to try ""Mlewi and Mtabga"" you find these everywhere in the Medina (I know some places)


And of course the fricassée (I know a great place, a little further of the medina, but the best in my opinion, I can help you in getting them)
And in ""Beb el Jazira"" there's a place my friend knows that makes the best Tunisian pasta ever, I will ask him for the location.


And in an alley next to ""Rue Jemaa Zaytouna"" there is a couple of tunisian sweets makers, one of the best things you'll ever try.
And never forget to try some Cafés in the Médina (like Panorama, Café Vert, Café Souk, Little sarrajine, el enba)


And I have some friends from Sousse, I will ask them about good places there.

Tunisia,local food,"I am thinking about moving to Tunis, is it a good idea? Please provide insights and advice ;)","Hello fellow Tunisians! I am currently living in Malaysia with my husband and toddler and I am thinking about moving to Tunis (La Marsa, Carthage, les berges du lac, these areas). I would like to gather your opinions about whether or not this would be a good idea, what I should be prepared for, etc. Really, any negative or positive things I should be ready for. 

Take into consideration the following reasons why I am considering Tunisia/my profile:  
1. I am Tunisian (but I do not speak the language), and my parents live in Tunisia. So I want to get closer to my family that is scattered around the Mediterranean.   
2. The life in Tunis seems pretty nice, affordable (cheap?), and laid back. The weather is also much better than Southeast Asia.   
3. I work online and I am my own boss, so I can pretty much live anywhere I want in the world, I just need a high speed internet connexion (optic fiber).   
4. I lived in many countries in Asia, Middle East, and Europe, this would be the first time in Africa, but I grew up in an North African family in France, so there will be adaptation but I am flexible and know the culture well (although I do not consider myself a local... yet).   
5. I have a 2 yo child, and I am considering the British school or the French school for kindergarden. I would love for her to learn Arabic.   
6. I love to stay at home and just chat with my parents, go to the gym, swim, and I love good food. I would also like to add Arabic lessons to my hobbies. 

So do you think this is a good idea or is it a monstruous mistake? I am not scared at all of moving, I am pretty much a nomad at heart, but I wish to have all of the information, even a qualitative assessment before moving forward. 

Many thank in advance for reading this long post, and I am looking forward to reading your insights.   
  
","I wouldn't call life in tunisia super cheap especially with the economic situation and we also have a new dictator in town so that's a factor in case freedom of opinion / political activity matters to you or to ur future child .

Another issue is how you're going to get paid and taxes which you need to research since they tend to be illogical and opressive for remote workers .

I assume your husband doesn't look foreign , if yes then you need to consider racism and with you both not speaking the local language you can become isolated very quickly .

-- ""  love to stay at home and just chat with my parents, go to the gym, swim, and I love good food. I would also like to add Arabic lessons to my hobbies.""

Honestly the best idea for you is to temporarly move ( 6 - 12 months or so ) , it wouldn't be complicated since your child is still young , test the waters , see how you feel about the country , live the day to day life , and then you can make a more informed decision .

Moving suddenly and without any backup could spell disaster since tunisia changed aloot these last years from what you remember and now with a crazy idiot in charge .",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1g3yfiv/i_am_thinking_about_moving_to_tunis_is_it_a_good/,"Tunis, Tunis, Carthage",General,en

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,local food,"Hello dear Tunisians, I just came back from vacation in Monastir and I have 3 maybe four questions for you. No bad feelings. ","Hello, I have to clarify that I absolutely enjoyed the vacation in your country. Even thoug I was accomodate in one of the many resorts I spent most of the time wandering around and inhaling your culture. However I have to ask a few questions.

1. how ""strong"" is the muslim religion in the country ? I noticed that ppl are quite passive regarding to religion. Comparing to Morocco, there is no mosque on every corner and ppl were not running to the mass.
2. I met a very kind ppl. during my stay. One of them went with me by his brother car in his free time to the leather manufacturer to ensure that its not a scam. Also in coffe bar, smiley and welcoming. I told the guy in a coffe bar that I will return because it was very good and when I actually came there the second day he was even friendlier and happier. I felt very welcomed (and not only as wallet carrier as in hotel services), also as local because when someone came he greeted him and manly hugged with handshake.I can easily say that this does not apply to the most of the resort personel. We met very nice ppl. as part of enjoyment team and also waiters, but the hotel service providers? hypocrisy on first place. A biggest friend in the beginning but If I refused to buy something he didnt even looked at me for a week nor greeted.  Are you the same also inbetween yourself or only to white faces - tourists with money. I know that this does not apply for everyone, my biggest surprised was that a very old lady wanted to scam us for a toilet fee. She asked 5 dinars, I send her very far, then she wanted 3 dinars, I gave her 200 mil. and afterall I gave her 1 and left. Like... srsly ?
3. why is litter and garbage everywhere ? Its not my first rodeo in arabic country but I still cant get it.
4. how is your hospital service in the country ? good ? bad ? I dont want to find out Im just curious.
5. could you please share some home-like recipes for couscous and lablebi ? I know that google can provide me any information what I need but I cannot recognize what is true recipe how you would cook it. I was invited to one of the locals home to try homemade food but no time for that. 1 week is not enough.
6. as Im enjoying the bargaining part of the shopping I still can't approximate how close Im to the local price. For example I bougth two leater pufs. It took me at least 15 minutes of bargaining to pay 120 dinars for both (he wanted 4x more at the beginning). It was quite dificult and he repeated that this is manufacturing price and he can't go lower he will not earn anything.  A very nice brushed leather handbag (not the regular tourist trap one) for my GF was 140 dinars and he wanted 600 at the beginning. Also leather belts -30 dinars each of better quality. I bargain tailored leather jacket and leather skirt from 600 euros to 200 and everyone was suprised thats a local price.  Will sellers sell under the price and then over the price to someone else to compensate or whats the strategy?

I have to say at the end that I enjoyed the stay very much and that is mostly because all of you.  You are not hostile (at least not to us) and acceptably annoying regarding to business.  I will definetely return again to explore more of your culture. I wanted to rent a car but my big plans were crushed by reality (time:) )

thank you",">3. why is litter and garbage everywhere ? Its not my first rodeo in arabic country but I still cant get it.

I honestly think that this is the worst part of our culture: people tend to consider the outside of their house as ""not their problem"", not as a shared good to preserve. I also think that we lack a lot of awareness about cleanliness: a lot of people are either dirty or do not put enough in hygiene. The day that we will face this, and not find lazy excuses like ""it's the government that doesn't put enough trash cans"", then we will be on a good path.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1frfp3w/hello_dear_tunisians_i_just_came_back_from/,"Tunis, Monastir, Unknown",General,en
Tunisia,local food,European refugee from Lebanon. I have questions.,"Hello everyone. I'm an Austrian citizen who has been living in Lebanon for the past year. I am sure you guys are all aware of the current situation and I am considering leaving Lebanon for a while until things settle down - mostly just to stop my parents from being worried sick all the time. I am heavily considering going to Tunisia (Tunis), it's a country I've wanted to (re)visit for some time. 

Now normally I'd do some research beforehand, but I literally decided to leave today, so this is about as spontaneous as can be. I have a bunch of questions that normally could be answered via some googling, but I hope you guys can forgive me given the circumstances.

&nbsp;

1.) How widespread and affordable is Airbnb? Is it easy to find a simple accommodation within a day or two?

2.) In general, how are the prices? Beirut especially is crazy expensive, comparable to western countries. I heard Tunis is cheaper?

3.) In Lebanon I would mostly use USD to pay for everything. This is not the case in Tunisia, right? You use the local currency here? 

4.) How easy will it be to navigate Tunis with only English (no French and Arabic).

5.) Google says I (Austrian passport) don't need a visa and can stay for 90 days. Is this correct?

6.) Are AC common? The heat in Beirut has been killing me and without AC I'd die.

7.) How many western tourist / expats are currently in Tunis? I am not familiar with the details but heard the tourist industry took a big hit after a terrorist attack some years ago?

8.) And by far the most important question: A German friend who lived in both countries said that the food in Tunisia is better and you guys are not afraid to add some spice to your food. Please tell me that's true??? <3 

Thanks everyone and again I apologize for the dumb questions, but I am literally calming my parents, packing, booking a ticket and talking to my landlord at the same time.","Western POV as Im not tunesian
1) Finding an airbnb might be a challenge due to it being full holiday season. You might be better of renting an appartment.
2) Tunesia is super cheap compared to west eu
3) Yes tunesian dinar is the way to go. Government sets exchange rate every day and thats not negotiable however banks and exchange agencies add their own fee which can make exchanging in one place better than another
4) Outside touristic places (such as Hammamet, la Marsa, Sousse) English can be very challenging. I also noticed the people are so nice they try in English while they dont understand what you mean.
5) Dunno about Austria but with my Dutch pasport I can stay 90 days without visa. Seeing austria is also Schengen it sounds correct.
6) Yes AC is very common, also in cafes and restaurants, rentals might not have one tho, we encountered a newly build rental appartment without one (then again it had central heating but no gas hooked up too).
7) Tunesia is still very popular, due to their low prices, good weather and good food (yes, spicy, 8))

Tunisia,local food,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Although I generally agree that people should consume local (not because of boycott but it's in general better for the economy) but they are literally calling to boycott local brands just because there is a foreign investor or because it's sold in Israel.

For those who don't know, food companies don't have control over where their products are sold, they aren't weapon companies (even them dont have total control but it's another story) it's third party exporters that sell their products wherever they want, also it's dumb to boycott Tunisian products because they are sold in Israel because it's basically Israel who is losing money to Tunisia.","si, fama effet ki taamel boycott. les marques l twensa ki yalkaw boycott ywaliw obligées soit maatech yexportiw soit yatlouu des produits okhrin qui remplacent les marques l mtabaa.

Tunisia,local food,Tips and questions for visiting Tunisia. ,"Firstly I appreciate this must get asked a lot so thank you for taking the time. Myself and my family are booked to visit Tunisia next June and I have some questions regarding visiting Tunisia that I'd appreciate help on.

Firstly I'm not dumb enough and naive enough to ask is Tunisia safe, like most cities I am traveled to I am sure it is fine you just need to be sensible.

Whilst a lot of our time will be taken in the resort it would be rather silly of me to not explore and experience the rich and vibrant history that Tunisia has to offer, with that in mind I also want to be respectful of local customs and practices and as such have a few questions. For clarification were visiting a resort in Monastir towards the Sousse end.

1. Food, I am a food lover and when visiting other countries I try to explore the local cuisine, I don't mean the ""local"" dishes they serve tourists in many resorts but I mean truly authentic local dishes. For me sea food is my passion and being on the coast I imagine the city has some amazing sea food places. With that in mind I would love your recommendation on both dishes to try and maybe even restaurant in the area.
2. When traveling the city and exploring. Am I best to hire a local guide for the day? Or explore myself, any must visit places? We plan to take a tour of Amphitheater of El Jem but any other attraction that you would say is a must? I have heard the mosques are beautiful but do they welcome visitors? I don't wish to be disrespectful and want to be as polite as possible.
3. Language and local customs. This is important to me, I appreciate the main language of Tunisia is Arabic with French being quite common, how common is English? Also any recommendeded phrases or sayings you'd suggest I learn to help communicate? I am a firm believer that as the visitor it is my duty to try to learn your language and customs and not expect the locals to cater for me. That said, I also wish to be respectful of customs and local traditions. Can anyone suggest areas or customs I should observe to be respectful, I know in some Muslim countries women should have their hair covered, outside of the resort would it be polite for my wife to do this with a scarf, or is it generally accepted that tourists wouldn't?
4.  And finally, currency and any other tips? I understand the Dinar is a closed currency and I need to get my Dinar there, I can't also take it out of the country, any tips for this? (Although I may be best asking on a travel group for this) And finally. Anything else you can suggest or tips you can give.

Thank you for taking the time and I am excited to visit your country. (And I don't just mean the holiday resort/beach)",No top comment,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fu2k6i/tips_and_questions_for_visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir",General,en

Your daily budget will depend on how you spend your day. I assume you have transport covered since you did not mention it (Don't use public transport, only Taxi).

For food, it depends on where you eat. For 3 meals a day, you can get the cheapest options for 20TND (~6$) or you can go to the most expensive places for 150DT (~50$).

Tunisia,local food,Growing the economy by attracting western retirees: Why not?,"Advanced economies (EU, CA/UK/AUS, Japan) have a very serious retirement problem. There's too many retirees and not many younger people to support them, this is not only by far the biggest problem for them but also will get way worse very soon as the most populous age range of people in most of these countries is retiring in the next few years.

I think this can be a huge win-win situation for a country like Tunisia. Let's say we get 500k retirees, each spending 20k USD/yr which is not enough to live in most advanced countries while at the same time a very comfortable life in Tunisia. That's not only 10 billion dollars of foreign currency coming to Tunisia every year (half of Tunisia's total exports) but we can tax it at a very reasonable 20% and get 2b/yr which is more than 10% of the government's budget. That money can be used to fund infrastructure (you know.. if we had a reasonable government) which will help sustain the extra people but at the same time help grow the economy. Retirees also won't have children so there wouldn't be an issue long term with integration and all the hard to solve issues that come with normal immigration.

On the other hand, you might think this will increase inflation. We can solve that to a large extent. First of all, the influx of foreign currency helps Tunisia counter the huge part of inflation that's external to us. But if we eliminate subsidies, most prices won't increase with local demand because a lot of our biggest issues are things we import and moving demand from a country to another doesn't change that. For things that can increase such as rent and real estate, we can tie this program or visa to buying or renting newly built properties targeted towards this program. That way it will shelter Tunisians from that inflation while boosting the construction industry.

You might think how would we attract such people? One of the biggest problems western countries have is the lack of doctors to help with this aging population. In Tunisia, we have the reverse problem (sort of), so instead of having our doctors leave to those countries to help with the aging crisis and at the same time benefit those countries, they can stay in Tunisia and get paid much more from the influx of retirees. Additionally, Tunisia has better weather than most of these countries (I'll admit the extreme heat might be a problem) and is close to the EU so they can visit easily or get whatever needs they have. Plus this is something that those countries will help with instead of oppose because it helps reduce pressure on their social programs which is wrecking their economies.

Obviously, this is all theoretical and this government will never do something like this because of ideological reasons... but it's food for thought",This is such a good idea.

I'd like to keep my expenses within a reasonable range but also don't want to miss out on great experiences. Any advice on how much money I should bring in Euros would be very helpful.

3. **Must-try Foods and Restaurants:** What are some traditional dishes I should try, and where can I find the best local cuisine in Hammamet?

4. **Mobile plan:** I'll be needing to use my phone and internet connection during my stay, which mobile company plan should I choose and how does it work in Tunis?

Tunisia,local food,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

PS: u/saihi We confirmed the fact about no-smoking signs in the restaurants and being offered and ashtray XD","Good to hear that you liked it

Tunisia,local food,How much is Lamb/ Goat Grill?,"Hi, we are currently holidaying in Tunisia, and left the hotel resort for the first time to eat today.

We wanted to try out where the local people eat so went to one of the ones with the meat hanging outside, let's call it a Grill. 

We asked for 1x Lamb Grill, this was to be 4 pieces of meat, we didn't want to eat too much.

We got: 

1.5L water - to share 
2x 4 pieces of Lamb, with a side of fries 
1 small can of coca cola.

We sent back the following as we only wanted the Lamb. 

2 x Plate of what I can describe as mixed grilled veg - which we sent back.
1 x bread basket - which we went back
2 x plate of spaghetti - which we sent back

We were charged 192 TND, from what we had seen in the city, alarm bells were going off that this was too much, so we queried it. 

There wasn't an itemised receipt, the man literally wrote '192,000'  on a piece of paper and gave it to us. When we asked to see the prices on the kiosk, we were told the machine wasn't working.

We only had 80 dinar on us, so I said we'll pay that and then go to the cash machine to get the rest. 

The man escorted us to the cash machine...I didnt trust the situation so made us  B line to the police check point, said I was going to bank de tunis, our escort suddenly left when I started speaking to the police. 

When I asked the police they said that the price of 192 was too high for the food we ate... we said we paid 80 dinar he said it was OK, but said we shouldn't eat outside of the check points.

So my question is, as a local, what is the price for a Grill?

We are quite happy to pay the local costs but this situation didn't feel right...","I can't give an estimate without knowing portions, how fancy the place is, etc. But I'd say around 30ish a portion. Nowhere near 192.

You're entitled to an itemized receipt (with tax listed) btw, AND a menu with listed prices, you can simply refuse to pay otherwise.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19am2bz/how_much_is_lamb_goat_grill/,"Unknown, Tunis",Inquiry,en

Tunisia,local food,Looking for tourism tips in Tunisia,"Hello guys,

I will be visiting Tunisia during November for a couple of weeks coming from Northern Europe. Really looking forward! I'm planning to stay in AirBNBs and travel between various cities to see and experience as much as I can. I'm not interested in tourist hotels or restaurants that make European food. I don't want to create an artificial barrier between me and local culture. I want to try Tunisian cuisine, experience local activities, feel the culture. I wanted to ask the community for some tips and tricks - anything that has to do with the late autumn season, tourists from Europe and their safety, must-visit places. My questions are genuine and if they sound harsh - I'm not looking to insult anyone, just to know what should I be worried about and what is fine. I understand every place has its own culture and unwritten rules and I'm looking to learn that.  


\- What cities / particular locations are of interest and must see?  
\- Is the cuisine similar throughout the country or various regions have their top dishes? What are the top dishes to try? (I don't have dietary restrictions)  
\- How's the bus / train infrastructure between the cities? Is there a website to pre-order tickets?  
\- Is it safe for the foreigner to drive around? How's the bribery culture? Should I expect being stopped by the police for the bribes without a reason?  
\- How's the night life? Is it a thing to go to the bars or night clubs during the weekend and what places are recommended to go to?  
\- Any strong DO NOTs? (I.e. never go to the Mosque with shorts, etc.)  
\- Should I be worried about jewellery and travel without it or is it generally safe in the streets?  
\- Maybe you feel there is something I didn't mention, but it is worth considering?  


Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward so much to this trip. :)","I will get back to qsts 1&2 later in the comment.

3/ the bus & train infrastructure in the country is barely average. There is no website you could pre-order tickets. You basically have to arrive at the station to buy ur tickets. The thing that will make you probably not choose trains/buses is confort & time which is the opposite of what you want. It takes you around 3 hours for around 200 km. And yes it is not comfortable in anyway. The best option for you in this case might be driving.. so renting a car. It costs you around 150 TND [our currency] per day. 
4/ It is safe for you to drive around. There is a high chance you would be stopped by the police yes BUT there is no reason for you to worry as long as you have the necessary papers. There are 4 necessary papers, ownership of the car/ insurrance on the car/ Valid driving liscence & ID. Ignore their attempts to take money as a bribe, if they have nothing against you you're safe. Also just a side note, as long as you're a foreigner they are more precautious when dealing with you.
5/ Night life in Tunisia is fine, it actually meets the purpose. I mean if you want smwhere to go out, have a few drinks and enjoy your night. It's really easy. Don't expect anything extra like themed parties, special events or really hardcore all_night parties . Don't also expect to be sweating on the dance floor since the music will probavly send you off (haha) but it's not bad overall. 4 cities are known with decent nightlife culture (Djerba-Hammamet-Sousse & Gammarth in Tunis) 
6/ My answer is there is not a single strong do not. Just stay out of trouble, like physical fighting or any form of violence .  Don't seek attention and it should be enough to keep you safe.
7/ With jewelry you're safe unless it's really late at night and the streets are empty.. Like if there is no one around and you are WALKING down the street with some jewelry and your phone in your hands, it would put you in some risk. My advice for you is keep it simple, nothing extravagant like a huge gold chain on your neck or anything of this sort and it should be good.  

Now going back to the first 2 questions. 
What cities and what to do in them really depend on your taste. There is a bit of everything. There is so much to see in different cities and it's convenient that Tunisia isn't a huge of a country so you could make it to the north/south/ coast during the same vacations. 
Since you're staying during the winter I'd say you visit Tozeur  in the south for the Sahara settings.
For food, try out different things and see what you like. 
I'll let the chance for others to elaborate more on these two subjects.

Are there any nightclubs? And if so, are they dangerous for tourists?

Thank you my brothers and sisters!","Hello and welcome to Hammamet !

While in Hammamet, you must try some local Tunisian dishes. Some popular ones include couscous, brik, tajine, mechouia Salad... Don't miss out on trying traditional tunisian sweets like makroudh and bambalouni. You can also find a variety of seafood options due to its coastal location.

Hammamet has several attractions worth exploring mainly but not only the medina (old town) is a charming area with narrow streets, shops, and cafes. The Kasbah, a fortress, offers panoramic views of the city. The Carthage Land amusement park is also a popular spot, especially if you're traveling with a group and many other places...

Alcohol is available,you can find it in bars, hotels, and some restaurants. However, it's important to be respectful and avoid excessive public displays of drinking.

There are many nightclubs that cater to tourists and locals alike. These clubs are generally safe, but it's always a good idea to exercise caution to enjoy your stay

Hammamet is a safe destination but it's always wise to take general safety precautions. Be aware of your surroundings, keep an eye on your belongings, and avoid isolated or poorly lit areas at night.

If you want suggestions for restaurants or nightclubs, or have a question, don't hesitate to ask !

Tunisia,local food,Should fast food joints be allowed in residential neighborhoods?,"The new trend of acquiring an old family home (RIP COVID victims) destroying the interior walls and turning it into a busy, loud and smelly fast food joint (usually kafteji, fried foods and BBQ) is affecting previously peaceful ""retirement"" neighborhoods.

The joints owners say that acquiring family homes from inheritors that want fast cash is the only way to afford a ""locale"" with foot traffic and usually near schools and bus stops.

Inheritors say their old family home will cost a fortune to renovate and they need cash ASAP.

The neighbors complain about the noise and the frying oil smell in their houses and on their clothes.

Do you have any recommendations of things to do in Tunis, and restaurants to visit that are a bit more local. The food excites me the most. I will be staying at La Marsa. Some recommendations of beaches to go for the day that are not so crowded.

In Tunis, I would suggest you go to Sidi Bou Saied (pretty close to Marsa), you can go to Medina and try the local food there (Kafteji, Lablebi, Brik, Fricasse, Shakshouka) and every restaurant you go tell them you want extra Harissa so you can enjoy the Tunisian experience to the fullest, Roman Ruins are also a must see in Tunis and a swim in Gammarth is pretty good.

Tunisia,cultural sites,Visiting this December. What do you think of this itinerary?,"Hi everyone,

I will be visiting Tunisia for 10 days this December and the below is my itinerary. After extensive research I came to the conclusion that I will be using mostly '*louages*' to travel between a place and another. I travelled to North African countries in the past and I also know that life is usually slow paced so I'm not hassling much regarding accommodation as will be traveling during a relatively low season period. I consider myself as a slow traveller as well so won't be rushing (*as long as I'm not late for my flight lol*)

I will be landing early afternoon in Tunis airport and the plan is to get downtown, get a 'louage' and start making my way south-bound. My plan is to arrive somewhere close to Douz and explore the area of Qibili, Chott el Djerid and Tozeur. Probably I would be required to change louage at Kairouan were I wouldn't mind staying an overnight there.

When I eventually arrive at Douz area, I will dedicate 3 days to explore the area and then head north directly to Tunis were I will be spending my last 3 days there to visit Sidi Bou Said, Tunis Medina and Roman/Byzantine archaeological sites. Not interested in going to Tattoonie area and Star Wars sets. Don't think it's worth the time.

Dunno if someone can answer this but what route should I take with the louages to arrive in Douz area? Does Tunis - Kairouan - Douz make sense or I'm missing something? I'm interested in outdoor, hiking, desert, food, culture. Not interested in congested cities and luxury resorts.

Any tips are highly appreciated. Can't wait to visit the country!

Tunisia,cultural sites,What is your favourite thing about Tunisia?,"Considering so many posts here are negative I thought we should have a celebration of the things we do like about our country. For all its faults Tunisia is truly one of the most diverse, naturally beautiful places on earth with a rich history and amazing culture. Having said that I would say my favourite thing is definitely the landscape and attractions, we have desert, snow, mountains, plains, ocean, islands and urban areas, and on top of that we have some of the best historical landmarks in the world representing our Roman, Phoenician, Imazighen and Arab identity (think el djem, dougga, traditional dwellings in Matmata, Carthage, Kairouan, Kerkuane), we have 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, we are a tiny country compared to our neighbours with a small population yet we produce so many famous international musicians, some huge names in football and other sports, we successfully evicted one of the world's strongest ever empires from our land, toppled a dictatorship, most people speak minimum 3 fuckin languages and to be honest I think we are the most underrated country in the world. 

I love Tunisia, we have a lot of problems that need addressing but negativity breeds negativity and I know a lot of us are sick of only hearing the bad things.

Tunisia,cultural sites,Visiting Tunisia,"Hello,

I'm Tunisian and have been living abroad for 15 years. I want to bring my boyfriend to my country to introduce him to my culture. However, my boyfriend has extreme OCD and hygiene anxiety, making it very challenging. His standards for cleanliness far exceed even the stringent American norms. He is highly sensitive to smells, including chemicals, bleach, and perfumes, which impacts his and my life.

I am concerned about taking him to places where hygiene standards might not meet his expectations, such as restaurants where employees don't use gloves or crowded areas with lower hygiene standards. While I would love to show him the medina and Kasbah, I might have to stick to more upscale restaurants and less frequented sites unless there are other suggestions.

Are there any authentic places that might also be suitable for someone who is extremely sensitive to sun, smells, hygiene, and spicy food? I know, my life with him is not easy, but I want him to enjoy the experience without too much discomfort. I even planned to visit in September instead of summer to avoid the peak crowds and extreme heat.
Please do not bash him. His anxiety around those things are out of his control and are a result of a hard childhood trauma. They are often the trigger of our arguments. 

Thank you for any advice you can offer.","I think he will have a hard time here, especially in the capital. The hygiene standards are very low, except if you go to fancy places.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1dnlnz1/visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,id

I'm taking a short holiday in Tunisia for six days. I'll fly in and out of Tunis and I think that gives me enough time to visit one other place. I'm undecided between Djerba and Sfax. I would love to visit all three but it seems too complicated to travel directly between those two places.

I heard the medina in Sfax is really good, and I like that it's apparently less touristy.

The villages and culture of Djerba also sound amazing, but I'm worried that it will be full of tourist resorts and souvenir shops.

Tunisia,cultural sites,Solo traveling to Tunisia for the first time,"Hey, I live in the US and will be solo traveling to North Africa in a few weeks. I’m staying in Tunisia for 5 days and need some advice on which city I should stay in. My flight lands in Tunis-Carthage international airport. I did some research and most people are recommending to stay in Sidi Bou Said but I’m not sure. I want to see historical sites and experience the authentic beauty of Tunisian food and culture. I don’t care much for resorts. I would really appreciate recommendations.","I would advice you to stay in Marsa yes, a very good advice. It’s a very pleasant “suburb” right at the beach, you are very safe there being a tourist and it will give you French Cote D’Azur vibes, very Mediterranean in the summer, lots of cafes and places to eat and alot of people outside till late at night due to the summer. 

From there u can move around by taxi. But as said u need to be aware of scammers. If u have traveled frequently before outside of the West you have some experience. If u speak some French that always helps. 
Don’t trust people who approach you, whatever they tell u etc. Anyone approaching u to try and stay in touch with u whether that’s by being “extremely helpful” or “too spontaneous”….avoid the MOFO. 

Carthage is a place of Roman ruins of course. Beautiful suburb of Tunis and close to Sidi Bou Said and Marsa. So easy to visit. Sidi Bou Said is well known and nice to visit, also has a small beach in the center where u can go for a swim. These three places are the better neighbourhoods/suburbs of Tunis. LAC 1 or 2 u have some nice places to go out for a drink at night. And then u also have Tunis the city center and all surrounding neighborhoods as well, not directly at the sea. There u need to know which place to go to. The Medina is in the city center and it’s big, old where u can taste the sphere of old times, lots of hidden cafes, restaurants and other places. Tiny pathways. However also where u will come across a lot of annoying locals trying to sell u as a tourist their stuff. 
A good advice is to always wear your sunglasses. No eye contact makes things easier. Especially in the Medina.

Since it hot as fuck remember that generally no sane Tunisian is going to wander around in the bright sun between daytime 12 and 16 o’clock. So don’t expect a lot if u visit the Medina around that time. Either go early meaning your there at 8 in the morning or late in the afternoon meaning at earliest around 5pm.

Tunisia,cultural sites,Seeking advice for a 7 day trip... in December,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a guy from Singapore who will be visiting in mid-December with my brother. Currently we study in France and the UK. We both love history and archaeology (museums, material culture, visiting sites), trying new food, and meeting new people to learn and exchange information. My brother is also into wildlife photography, although I suppose December is off-season.

 Currently, we're thinking of flying into (and maybe out of?) Tunis. Unfortunately neither of us drive, but we're down to catch a bus/louage/taxi/train as needed. 

I had this itinerary in mind, but wanted to check in with the far more knowledgeable people over here if this seemed like a doable plan, or if there are improvements that could be made! 

**Day 1:** Fly into Tunis; see the Bardo Museum + Medina

**Day 2:**  Day trip to Sidi-bou-Saïd 

**Day 3:** Day trip to Carthage

**Day 4:** Day trip to Dougga 

**Day 5:** Louage (?) to Sousse, see Archaeological Museum

**Day 6:** Day trip to Kairouan 

**Day 7:** Day trip to El Jem. 

**Day 8:** Fly out of Monastir (?) 

A few questions. 

1: As you can see, we are basing ourselves in Tunis for four nights and Sousse for three - would you recommend this? 

2: Are there places to see wildlife in winter? The Ichkeul National Park looks lovely but seems out of the way, and possibly not that active in December. 

3:  What would you suggest we do in Tunis/Sousse in the evenings/nights? I'd love to check out any art centers or any interesting things that are going on. 

4: Anything food-wise that's underrated which I should try? I love the few times I've tried Tunisian food here in France, but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg.

5: What would you recommend I read or watch to learn about Tunisia? Academic books are fine, blogs are wonderful. My French is not fantastic, and neither my brother or I speak Arabic, so sadly English resources are preferable. 

Thanks in advance to everybody! I hope one day I can repay back anything I've learnt here - if you have any questions about Singapore, or England/Paris where we studied/are studying, for instance, I would be happy to have them. 

P.S. /u/scafidi_travels has produced such amazing resources! His playlists are so in-depth, but I don't have a good sense of how these fit into an itinerary where I won't rent a car. 

Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm doing anything stupid!

Tunisia,cultural sites,I visited Tunisia last week. Loved it! I have a few questions about the country and culture…,"Hey guys,

First off, I loved your country! The people were so friendly and the sites were incredible. I had an amazing time…an underrated gem for sure.

I have a few questions about the modern culture of Tunisia. 

I hope none of these questions come across as offensive or closed-minded. I am just trying to learn more about how things work and expand my understanding, and these are things I was curious about but I couldn’t ask anyone there.

&#x200B;

* Tunisia seems to be one of the most progressive Arab countries I have been to. From what I’ve been told, women either wear a hijab or don’t …it’s a personal decision and it’s not frowned upon at all to not wear one. Is this true? I noticed that the younger women also were dressed very casual, some even showing more skin than I’ve seen in other Arab countries. Has it always been like this? Or would you say it’s a change that is more recent (within the last decade or so)?
* I’m curious about the role of men versus women from a cultural perspective. Are most households dual earners with both men and women working? Or is it mainly the men who work and the women stay home? Are things mostly equal? I’m contrasting this to other Arab countries I’ve visited, as it seems like Tunisia is quite different.
* I was mostly in the well-traveled parts of Tunis, so I didn’t go to any of the poorer areas. But even when driving through many different parts of Tunis, I didn’t see many homeless people at all. Is homelessness not a big issue in Tunisia? It’s a big problem in my home country so it was interesting to not see many homeless or beggars.
* Was daily life very different before Arab Spring? If so, how has it changed?
* What is the main economy in Tunisia? What sort of jobs do people out of college get? Is there much job opportunity in Tunisia?
* English speaking: some people said everyone learns English at school and speaks it, but then I would meet people younger than me who didn’t speak any English at all. Just curious if English learnings is based on if you went to public vs private school or something else?
* What is the biggest problem in Tunisia right now? For ex, in the US our current biggest problems are probably around healthcare or racism.
* I’m curious what Tunisian people honestly think about their country. I’m sure it’s varies a lot. Just trying to understand the general feeling people have towards Tunisia there. 

Thank you very much and thank you for having me in your lovely country!","Let me try to answer your questions: 
1. Things have changed over the past decade. Hijab was not allowed before so many women weren't allowed to wear it to school or if they worked in the public sector. So, in the bigger cities, women dressed more casual than they do today. After the revolution, religious oppression finally ended and women were free to dress however they want. 

2. Because of how life is getting in Tunisia, paying the bills requires two incomes. That's why many people will look for partners with jobs. The gender is kind of irrelevant. However, in other aspects of life, equality might not be as ""important"". Many men still don't want to share the household chores and women are viewed as the main children's raisers. Fathers ""help around"". 
In rural areas and because of the lack of jobs, you have the more traditional roles ( women taking care of household and children, men going out to work ) 

3. Homelessness in Tunisia is not really common because of how collectivistic our culture is. Family is really important and like someone else mentioned, we don't let each other go hungry or be homeless. Kids rely on their parents for support when they are young and parents rely on their kids for support when they are old and that's how it works. Extended family is also important, helping out aunts and uncles is not uncommon. 

4. Daily life wasn't different per se before Arab spring. The Arab spring really uncovered how poor we are, corruption was well hidden before and now it's out in the open so-to-say. 

5. Tourism used to be a big part of the economy and that's why the country is struggling right now. Other than that, we have a lot of fields so agriculture is important and also we have some industrial sites ( but this makes up a small percentage of our GDP ) 

6. We do learn English in school ( public schools are the backbone of Tunisian education, many people don't afford private schools and even if they did, public education used to have a good reputation )  but not nearly as long as we learn french and we don't practice it on the streets like we do with french. So many people tend to forget it. The young generation is now more into English that french so I think English will eventually be also more spoken on the streets but that's just my assumption. 


7. Biggest problems are in my opinion the lack of jobs and the political instability. The problem of the average Tunisian is that things got expensive and income source didn't increase. Because of the political instability many companies closed and left the country and because the joblessness which is what started the Arab spring many companies will pay you very little. 
I think if people find jobs, the situation will vastly improve. But of course, that's very convoluted with what happens politically and things won't change overnight. 

8. Most Tunisians don't have access to opportunities within their country, therefore many of us leave and resent the country. But we are still very patriotic abroad at least. Within the country, when you deprive the normal human being of a chance to earn a living ( or make it very difficult for people to do that honestly), then patriotism and whether we care or not about the country becomes an very insignificant question. People are too busy trying to survive, so patriotism is definitely out of the window. And the need to belong somewhere doesn't matter anymore.",43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/sn7qyy/i_visited_tunisia_last_week_loved_it_i_have_a_few/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,cultural sites,"freedom, body integrity, sexuality and the conservative madness","The conserative view on sexuality is completely disconnected from reality and that causes harm to both individuals and any society in which they are applied as a whole. I'll speak about transgenders, circumcision, homosexuality and the anti-scientific approach conservatives have to these issues. I will explain why allowing homsexuals and transgender people to exist and have their rights protected will help them and society. I will also explain why I think infant circumcision should be made illegal.

I'll begin with the most obvious, and the easiest one for people to understand : having the right to sleep with whoever you want is a basic right.

- *Comparision to zoophilia and pedophilia*. When the conservative will try to argue against homosexuality they will often make a slipery slope fallacy in which homosexuality will allow zoophilia and pedophilia. that a logical fallacy called slippery slope. And sometimes they will compare homosexuality to zoophilia and pedophilia, this is also another logical fallacy, a false analogy. In a homosexual relationship between 2 adults there is consent, and there's no harm done to the people involved in the act. And absolutely no harm done to any other person.

- *Unnatural* : This is another logical fallacy : an appeal to nature. We can't say something is good or bad because it is natural or unnatural. Cancer is natural, it is still not a good thing. These people use phones and watch TV. You can't get more unnatural than that. In addition, they will defend circumcision to the death which is a surgery which actually harms the body and causes damage (I'll get to the details later)

- *religion* : Religion is about a subjective ""truth"", that's why we use the term ""belief"" instead of knowledge. In addition the religious interpretations are very very different : You can still be muslim, be okay with homosexuality and against circumcision. The quran says nothing about homosexuality and muslims quote ""no compulsion in religion"" and ""you have your religion and I have mine"" all the time. Fucking practice what you preach. If you believe these quotes are valid, then you are a secular muslim and should be progressive aswell. And if you believe homosexuals will go to hell, we genuinely do not care. Keep it to yourself.

Circumcision

This is one should be very fucking obvious but people need explanation of the science behind it and why it was advocate for in the past, but is a dying practice everywhere and should be banned (at least for children and teens)

- *First, there's no benefit*. They will mention that it decreases some infections but they will never tell you the details. And the devil is in the details. The doctor will tell you that circumcision will decrease the rate of UTI (an infection) by 60% IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BIRTH ONLY (basically a prevention). This sounds big, but, they say the RR instead of the DR for a reason, the risk of UTI for uncircumcised children  is already low : 1%. And an immediate risk of complication DURING the surgery alone (not after it, just during it) is 2%. This includes a vast range of complication which include death. And UTI is a treatable disease. Another claim is AIDS. In the US they used to cicumcise but not in Europe, yet the rate was much higher in the US than Europe.  There are much better and more efficient ways to deal with AIDS than circumcision. I'm going to be charitable and use the studies which favor the most circumcision : reduces transmission from female to male by 60%, but has no effect on transmission from male to female. Using a condom and abstinating from having sex with random people + legalizing homosexuality have a much much better effect on reducing AIDS. 

- *The harm* :  Here is where most people don't know the truth. The complications of the surgery can literally destroy the life of the person. For example, when you circumcise a child under a certain age it is dont WITHOUT anesthesia. This is obviously torture. And the excuse ""he will not remember"" is factually incorrect and makes it even more immoral. We don't torture people affected by Alzheimers and justify it with ""he will not remember"". an act is immoral independant of the capacity to remember. Harm that is done to most people and is NOT REVERSIBLE is loss of sensitivity, and the loss of pleasure during sexual intercourse. Also women report having more pleasure, less pain and dryness with uncircucumcised men. Does this mean circumcied men are inferior for women ? no, use lube mf. there is more harm than this. For example, many men lose comfort in their day to day life because of friction with clothes or other minor things that should not be inconvinient.

- *Hygiene* : using water and soad is necessary. We don't advocate cutting ears because they can get dirty, we clean them. It is the same for the foreskin. Just wash.

- *personal choice* : many men regret having been circumcised in many parts of the world ESPECIALLY if they know the facts behind it. There's a study which shows that well informed adults are less satisfied with their circumcision (some get into depression, and/or seek the help of a therapist). Circumcising a child is by definition sexual assault. There's no good evidence that it is harder to circumcise adults or that it has worst outcomes, and even if it has worse outcomes for adults, it is not an excuse to circumcised every male. Having read the studies put forth to prove that circumcision has better outcomes when performed on children, these studies have many problems. For example, they follow the adults for months or years after the surgery and take note of the complications which happen DURING and AFTER the surgery. But, they don't do that for the children, they only take note of the complications which happen DURING the surgery. If you are a muslim and still want to circumcise, you can do it when you grow up, at any time you want. Just don't push it so that others be circumcised aswell.

- *phimosis and some other disease which are treated by circumcision* : Circumcision is used to TREAT these illnesses and not to PREVENT them. So routine circumcision can not be justified on this basis. In addition many of these pathologies can be treated through much less invasive ways. And using the existence of these pathologies to justify circumcision is as stupid as saying : migraine exists therefore we should all seek the teatment for it, or cancer exists therefore we should all use chemo.

I have a burden of proof, Here are some studies and quotes.

""The AAP does not recommend routine circumcision."" The AAP is the American Academy of Pediatrics.
""However, they said that because of the possible benefits, parents should have the option to circumcise their sons if they want to. They recommend that parents discuss circumcision with their baby's health care provider. Parents should make their decision based on the benefits and risks, as well as their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences.""

We wouldn't allow FGM using the excuses of ""personal preference"" (there are many types of FGM some of which are as harmful as male circumcision). Or we wouldn't excuse the 

https://medlineplus.gov/circumcision.html

""Risks related to circumcision:

Bleeding

Infection

Redness around the surgery site

Injury to the penis

Some research has suggested that uncircumcised male infants have an increased risk of certain conditions, including:

Cancer of the penis

Certain sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV

Infections of the penis

Phimosis (tightness of the foreskin that prevents it from retracting)

Urinary tract infections

The overall increased risk for these conditions is thought to be relatively small.

Proper hygiene of the penis and safe sexual practices can help prevent many of these conditions. Proper hygiene is especially important for uncircumcised males.""

This article even clearly states ""Proper hygiene of the penis and safe sexual practices can help prevent many of these conditions. Proper hygiene is especially important for uncircumcised males.""

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002998.htm

""Penile problems, such as irritation, inflammation, and infection, are more common in uncircumcised males. It's easier to keep a circumcised penis clean, although uncircumcised boys can learn how to clean beneath the foreskin once they're older.
Some people claim that circumcision lessens the sensitivity of the tip of the penis, decreasing sexual pleasure later in life. But none of these subjective findings are conclusive.""

know that there are article which CONFIRM there's a loss of sensitivity. Basically, the glans starts making keratin to protect itself from the enivronment and lose sensitivity with time : that's why just after circumcision men are more uncomfortable in they day to day life than after a long period of time : the glans loses sensitivity. Also, these changes are the cause of feelings of dryness during intercourse.

Transgenders

This topic is the most difficult to explain because most people don't understand the basic concepts behind it.

- *Gender and sex* : these are not the same thing. Gender is more the way you behave/think. And sex is the biological sex. Basically gender is used to force people act/think a certain way and those who don't fit these patterns of behavior will identify with a different gender. I think gender should be abolished. When it comes to sex that's a completely different discussion.

- *Defining woman* : we can define woman in many different ways, but ulitimately it is hard to define. We have a similar problem with many other words. Some will say ""If she can give birth, then she's a woman"", but many women can't give birth since birth. So the easiest definition, is having a vagina or a penis. A surgery can simply change the a penis into a vagina now. This something that can be done and is practiced in med. The external genital organ for males and females share the same embryonic origin which only change shape.

- *defining man* : We face the same problems as with defining woman.

- *Freedom to do whatever you want with your body* : Don't you find it wierd that conservatives think forced circumcision on children is okay but changing one's OWN sex is unacceptable to them ? Well, this is why we think they're backwards and inconsistent. They defend immoral practices then attack people who are not harming anybody.

Conservatives :

- *Inconsistencies* :  they will defend circumcision on children who can not consent any day, and justify it with ""religious freedom"", but they will deny homosexuals their rights religious freedom. This is why when a tunisian conservative mentions religious freedom, you know they are lying. The status quo in Tunisia is anti-religious freedom and even anti-freedom of speech in many cases. Being conservative in Tunisia means you either want to defend that horrible status quo or make it worse.

- *Logical fallacies and hypocrisy* : they make many different logical fallacies in their reasoning. But if they really thought unnatural things are bad for example, they would stop using phones, wearing clothes and will just become anarcho-primitivists. And they're not anarcho-primitivists. In addition they expect homosexuals to never have sex, while every heterosexual man will have his sexual desires satisfied. So conservatives are by definition hypocrites.

- *They harm the country* : They want to force their SUBJECTIVE preferences on other ADULTS and treat them like CHILDREN. They cause division among people and alienate many minorities just to achieve their goal which is not even a moral or valuable one. for example, saying that Tunisia must have a muslim government because it has a muslim majority is not only  MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DEMOCRACY MEANS, but is also ANTI-REVOLUTION. They ignore that tunisians can be non-muslim, not straight and have many other characteristics and STILL BE TUNISIAN.","Conservative People who are negative toward lgbt are negative toward sex, nudity and sexual desire in general. They believe you should submit your personal appetite and desires to the needs of the family, which is primarily : making as many babies as possible and fighting for the survival of the group. What you wanted personally didn't matter at all. It's what the Power wanted from you. Conservatives are very uncomfortable dealing with intimate desire and their true emotions. They only think in terms of honor.

Tunisia,cultural sites,Tourist during Eid al-Fitr (Tunis),"Hi all,

Coming friday, I'll arrive in Tunis to spend ten days for work in Tunisia (checking out archaeological sites). I only just realized that, from friday on, Eid al-Fitr will be held. I am not accustomed to Muslim holidays or rituals at all and I'm wondering if there are things I should think about. Are all shops and museums open? Is everyone allowed again to eat and drink in public? Are there specific things organized, also for non-Muslims, such as fairs and markets? From what I read online, its a public holiday, but I would like to hear what it specifically entails.

I'm really exited to visit Tunisia, can't wait to get in touch with Tunesian and Muslim culture and really looking forward to my first encounter with Eid al-Fitr!! Thanks in advance!","During Eid al fitr yes you already will find people eating in public do you can feel free ❤️

Tunisia,cultural sites,For a secular state that recognize its history !,"Tunisia is, unfortunatly, considered as an arab country it's also mentionnel in the first article of the Tunisian contitution : 

''Article premier :
La Tunisie est un État libre, indépendant et souverain, l’Islam est sa religion, l’arabe sa langue et la
République son régime.

Le présent article ne peut faire l’objet de révision'' (source : http://www.legislation.tn/sites/default/files/news/constitution-b-a-t.pdf ) 
While Tunisia was never Arab, it was the invasion by arabs that brought islam as well the Arabic language, which is according to the constitution is the official language of the country, (while really) without being our mother tongue:

We do not even use Arabic in our daily life we ​​rather use our dialect, which is influenced by other languages ​​including Arabic / French / Berber ...Certainly it has made us Arabic speakers not Arabs, as well the French invasion that made us French speakers and not French.

So the first article alone quietly suppresses the whole history of Tunisia and all of North Africa, and make us Arabs (as an ethnic group) who speak Arabic as a mother tongue, added to that, a muslim state.

I would like to hear from you all because I think it's quite disrespectful and unfair.
Thanks.","We're not Arabs as an ethnic group, Arab stopped being and Ethnicity and became a cultural Identity 1300 years ago.
The Islamo-Arabic culture isn't Alien to us, nor is the DNA for that matter, Tunisian IS Arabic, i don't speak french words.
And we'll remain a Muslim country (secular or not) so long 90% of Tunisians believe they are, and no matter how much some ""elite"" would ever scream ""3000 years"".

We made a huge chunk of this civilization and it's ours to own and deal with whether it's bad or good.

Drop the snowflake identitarian mentality, being of a special ethnic origin (regardless of how dubious the claim is) gives you no higher place. we say عرب كرب  when the bus skips the station, and the كرب  part is what's likely to remain even if we tomorrow called ourselves Polynesians.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5qr5sk/for_a_secular_state_that_recognize_its_history/,"Unknown, Tunis",Cultural Inquiry,en
Tunisia,cultural sites,Archeologist Guide Recommendations (Kerkouane Site),"Hi, Redditors and Tunisia-folk. 

First-time travel to Tunisia in May of 2022. I'm a freelance writer and novelist and am looking to bolster the authenticity of my book (time-travel sci-fi to the period of the 1st Punic War, ICYI). But, anyhow...

I'll be staying in Tunis. Carthage, Bardo, Tophet, Punic Harbor, (and yes, Roman Baths even though it's outside of period), are all on the menu. Nosh nosh. These'll be self-guided.

I really want to see Kerkouane though too. However, for that, I'd really feel more comfortable if a graduate-level archeology or PhD knowledgeable in this site first, and Carthaginian culture second, could accompany and guide me.

The bona fides and due diligence met, I'd be willing to pay, of course,

Any takers? Advice?

Thanks!

PS: In my novel, I plan to paint the Carthaginian/Phoenician culture in all shades (from what we best know) both the good and the ill, including child sacrifice. That being said, however, aside from the Hannibal fanboys, the varied cultures of North Africa have been painted in a negative light for far too long, as has much of Africo-Meghrebi society. As a writer, I'm striving to correct that.

Tunisia,hidden gems,Hidden Gems in Tunisia: What Are Your Favorites?,I'm planning a trip to Tunisia and I'm curious – what are some lesser-known spots or hidden gems in the country that most tourists miss but are totally worth checking out?,"It depends on what kind of tourists you mean. Most come on package vacations to the Sahel and Djerba, but in doing so miss the whole country.  

 The northwest of the country is my single favorite place in the world. You do get some tourists in Ain Draham and Tabarka, especially during hunting season, but they seem to be totally missed by most people. Bni Mtir is a tiny village next to Ain Draham and it’s like a fairytale. The rural areas around Beja are stunning, especially in the Mogods. Nefza is charming, and it has plenty of hiking/camping near Cap Negro. There’s a small ecotourism industry around Beja. If you take the road from Cap Negro to Bizerte, you can pass by Sejnane and Mateur, which are both towns I like. Ras Angela is the northernmost point of the African continent, and it has a good beach. East of Bizerte, Raf Raf and Ghar El Melh are beautiful—both are widely known by Tunisians but less so by foreigners. I personally also love Testour and Dougga (which is better known, due to its ruins).  

 El Kef is absolutely incredible, including the Table de Jugurtha, but I’d urge not to go further south than the city itself, as it becomes heavily securitized as you get closer to wilayat Kasserine, and you may be refused entry and escorted out of the region (speaking from experience). In wilayat Siliana, Kesra is a beautiful old Amazigh village in the mountains. ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1h7yxoi/hidden_gems_in_tunisia_what_are_your_favorites/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

I am 23 living abroad for almost 4 years now. Lately, I've been feeling like I've been away for too long and slowly losing touch with myself due to the fast-paced European lifestyle. (only went back for visiting few times and just for few days each time)
I used to love camping and going on adventures, but it's been way too long since I've done anything like that. I ve been traveling and shit but i have always wanted to experience the van life that you would see popping on yt on your recommended page fron now and then, so here is my plan:
This summer i am going on a camping adventure across the country. I'll be traveling for about a week or so, either by car or public transport if necessary.  sleeping in a tent for the most part but if I feel like it, I might opt for a hostel. I also have friends all over that I might stay with, depending on where I end up.
I am open for suggestion for destinations/ places you guys went to or simply worth seeing, keeping in mind that i am from the north(Bizerte) and wanna go places i never been to
I might go alone and meet up with friends along the way, or I might ask my close friend group if anyone wants to tag along but Either way, I'm sure it's going to be an amazing experience!
My goals for this journey are to visit new places, experience that adrenaline rush we all love, make core memories, and have fun. 
Do you guys know of any TN camping-related subreddits or Facebook pages that could help? Also, what are some hidden costs that I might be overlooking?

I've always dreamed of visiting Japan, but I'd like to hear from our Tunisian community members who have already been there. Your insights and experiences would be incredibly helpful in planning my future trip. 🗾🌸

**Questions for fellow travelers:**

1. **Budget**: Can you provide an approximate budget for your trip to Japan? This would include expenses like airfare, accommodation, food, transportation, and any activities you engaged in.
2. **Itinerary**: I'm curious about your travel itinerary. Which cities or regions did you explore? Any particular attractions, cultural sites, or hidden gems you'd recommend?
3. **Accommodation**: Where did you stay during your visit? Were you more inclined towards hotels, hostels, or Airbnb accommodations? Any specific recommendations?
4. **Cuisine**: Japan is known for its incredible food culture. What were your favorite Japanese dishes or dining experiences? Any must-try restaurants or street food stalls you'd suggest?
5. **Transportation**: How did you get around in Japan? Did you use public transport, rent a car, or explore by other means? Any tips for navigating the Japanese transportation system?
6. **Language Barrier**: How did you manage the language barrier, if any? Were there any language apps or phrases that proved particularly useful?
7. **Cultural Experiences**: Did you participate in any cultural activities or festivals during your visit? Any memorable encounters or cultural insights to share?

Tunisia,hidden gems,Benzart beaches,"Can someone please suggest a good beach location in Benzart, I'm planning for a road trip soon and I would like to either go to a hidden gem and the least crowded place.
Ofc I hear alot about Ghar El mela and other popular places, but I want to hear your opinion.
Most of the time popular in Touness means Dirty and crowded
Appreciated 🙏","Hey there! a local from Benzart here, Marhbe bik! so i'm gonna split this into two for you dear friend the typical sand beaches and the deep waters if you're good at swimming in those...

For the beaches you got: -Ghdir el Ain situated in Cap Zebib (my hometown so yeah a bit of bias here), it's pretty cool and you got some restaurants here and there around it but they are overpriced even tho they're locals so be cautious) it's pretty chill and it's just a place for families to go, might be crowded a bit but hey, you got a natural water source there so its good enough) -El Demna got a cool beach if you're ready for a hike or you got an offroad vehicule, it's pretty chill all the time, mostly the locals go there with their families and it's most of time pretty empty so yeah you can chill in peace) -Chat el Mami situated in Ras Jabel, a popular place which is often crowded but it's quite large and open so it won't be that hard to find a chill place and don't go for the restaurants there, they charge a lot for nothing so get your picnic blanket, bring some foods and snacks and have fun! -Bhar Hassen situated also in Ras Jabel and its quite accessible with a vehicule, it's not too bad from what i saw the last time i went but Ras Jabel in itself is quite crowded so the beach there might be too) -Ain Mestir which is a popular place situated in Sounine and it's a beautiful beach and quite large too so you can have your space there -Corniche Rafraf situated in... Rafraf exactly, ummmmmm this one is pretty meh but just for the Rafraf Vibe that it gives off and that little nighty walk on the corniche and staring at the sea while sipping a cup of tea, it gets a mention BUT ITS HELLA CROWDED -Chat El Mami, a nice casual beach which is large and got some attractions (sometimes) like that parachute thing while you're attached to a Jetski or simply a Jetski ride but they can be pricey but it's VERY CROWDED aswell, sometimes if not all the time you can find a line of cars waiting to get in there so yeah -Ras Angela got a nice beach and it doesn't get filled up with people or anything and hey it's the most northern point in our sweet continent so yeah it's a symbolic swimming session there and i'm sure many more but those are the ones that i would recommend from what i know

And for the deep waters you got: -El Jwebi situated in Cap Zebib which is in my honest opinion and not at all biased, the GOAT swimming spot... it's split into 4 Jwebis each one got it's diving spots and its amazing but can get crowded but please be cautious there as it's infamous for people dying there because they are not good swimmers or they just risked jumping like it's nothing -Ghdir el Kasbah situated in Cap Zebib/Metline, it's a very cool place but yeah a strong vehicule or a hike to access it but it's really worth it as the water is crystal clear and never crowded so yeah

So yeah those are the ones i know and can recommend to you as a local guy from Benzart... You're more than welcome here and i hope you enjoy your roadtrip in our sweet Benzart!

Tunisia,hidden gems,Why doesn't tunisia promote/advertise their historical sites for tourism?,"I'm from norway and im taking a bachelor in history, currently second year, i want to write my final thesis on carthage as when i studied roman history i fell in love with hannibal and carthaginian history as a teenager. I knew about a lot of the historical facts but actually i had no idea about especially the ROMAN sites in tunisia, untill i visited 3 times the last 10 months due to my fiance being from tunisia. I knew about the carthage ruins, which are cool for someone especially interested like me and bardo museum is great too but for standard tourists i dont think they would care that much. However you have hidden gems. Everyone knows about the colosseum, rome is already an incredibly popular tourist destination and of course theres more to rome than colosseum, but the point is its a very popular destination. I study carthaginian and roman history and i had no idea el jem existed untill a year ago. I was lucky to visit december last year and it blew my mind. Its basically just a slightly smaller colosseum, a bit worse shape but even when i visited there was workers there doing renovation work, and yes i know i visited during corona but that place was EMPTY. like it was me, my fiancee, the workers and maybe 4-5 other people. Colosseum is completely full at all times, and i believe theres reasons for this. First of all of course rome is way more accesible, we reached el jem on a 2.5ish our drive from tunis, and the rest of el jem is nothing, like its just a town that has NOTHING in it except for the amphiteatre, while rome has so much more to offer than just the colosseum. I have been in hammamet and sousse and i have seen what kind of infrastructure and tourist friendly enviorements tunisians can create, but tunisia in my opinion is so much more than 5 star hotels and beaches? If you built some resturants, did some promoting, anything around your historical past you could attract so many tourists, at least thats my opinion. Tourists come to norway and scandinavia in general all the time due to our beautiful nature and our viking history, and we also promote that, of course due to the recent success of viking entertainment on tv everything has been more well known, but i really believe if tunisia made an effort they could profit hugely and also create a lot of jobs. Hire builders and make el jem tourist friendly with hotels and resturants, make it appealing to visit not just for history nerds, you have so much hidden potential there.

Tunisia,hidden gems,A Week in Tunisia - Tour Guide Help,"I'm going to be spending about a week in Tunisia in late July. I'm looking for a tour guide to show me around as much of Tunisia as possible.   


Some activities I would like to do are exploring Tunis with a local, 4x4 in the desert, camping/hotel in the desert, riding a camel, swimming in an oasis, exploring the mountains (no specific one in mind), as well as seeing some very rural nature areas (no specific one in mind here either). Very open to suggestions of other stuff to do besides that, as well. 

&#x200B;

**A few questions:**

1) Around how much should a 4-5 day adventure like this with a tour guide cost?  
2) Any recommendations on which tour guide to go with? I want a more authentic tour guide and am not as much of a fan of touristy stuff, but I also only speak English.

Tunisia,hidden gems,Local food and restaurants in Tunis?,"We are a couple from Germany staying in the Tunis medina and we love food. Do you have any nice local places or hidden gems we must try while we’re here? Of course we have our own research but having local advice is always better :) we will also be travelling to sousse, touzeur and djerba so nationwide advice is welcome! Je parle Français alors des vrai locaux sans anglais pas de problème ! Merci 🙏 ","Hello! Welcome to Tunisia, I hope you enjoy your stay!


To have the ""authentic experience"" I advise you to first try the original Tunisian fast food that people casually eat, these are found everywhere across the Medina, and although many of them are good places, there is some better one's.
I advise you to try the Tunisian fast food called Kafteji (made of fried eggs, potato, and other yummy things), you can have it as a plate or as a sandwich, there's a known place called ""Hatab"", unfortunately I do not recall the name of the steeet.


Also, in the ""rue de la Kasba"" there's a good place that sella kafteji and other Tunisian plates you should try it, I forgot the name of the place tho, and right next to it there's a place that makes a Sandwich called Chapati in the Mahdese way.
Also, there's a place called ""Oueld El Hadj"" in ""Bed Jedid"", the way of the Kasbah.
For a fancier experience, there's an excellent place called ""Dar BelHadj"", it's close to the Zaytouna's mosque, you can find it in maps; it offers many Tunisian plates in a fancy building with traditional architecture, a real gem you should try.



Also, in Tunis Downtown, although not Tunisian plate, but an extremely delicious one, in ""rue de Marseilles"" there's a small place called ""chicken house"" it makes Shawarma in indian bread, one of the best things you can try in Tunis.
And never forget to try ""Mlewi and Mtabga"" you find these everywhere in the Medina (I know some places)


And of course the fricassée (I know a great place, a little further of the medina, but the best in my opinion, I can help you in getting them)
And in ""Beb el Jazira"" there's a place my friend knows that makes the best Tunisian pasta ever, I will ask him for the location.


And in an alley next to ""Rue Jemaa Zaytouna"" there is a couple of tunisian sweets makers, one of the best things you'll ever try.
And never forget to try some Cafés in the Médina (like Panorama, Café Vert, Café Souk, Little sarrajine, el enba)


And I have some friends from Sousse, I will ask them about good places there.

This gave me the idea to create a subreddit dedicated to Tunisian History which will allow our hidden gem of a country to get the attention it deserves.

Will serve as the main place for Tunisian historical posts that will also be crossposted to the adequate subreddits.

But for that to happen I need your help

Tunisia,places to visit,Got a 100% scolarship in Malaysia.Should I go?,"I got a 100% scolarship in a chinese university based in Malaysia called Xiamen University Malaysia that's ranked 364th worldwide(for reference it only opened its doors 8 years ago) and 49th in Asia.

I will list the pros and cons that I have found so far and help me decide


Pros:

1/As long as I'm in the top 35% of my class, I would not have to pay the tuition fees(19000dt)


2/Everything's the same price or even lower compared to Tunisia and especially PC parts(300/400Dt lower with a lot more offers to choose from)

3/Campus is big and has a lot of facilities including Basketball and swimming which I do like

4/Dual Accreditation in the sense that I get a Malaysian and Chinese degree

5/Would be a chance to learn how to live on my own/rely on myself since I would be far away from my parents

6/Rent is cheap( the dorm is 200DT but it's only compulsory to stay in it for a year and then one can move out)

Cons:

1/Far away place and this isn't a complaint for me but my parents have expressed concerns since I would  rarely be able to visit

( doesn't help that we only get 2.5/3 months of vacation, 1.5 months in August and a month in January, this is for the undergraduate programm and I haven't been able to find schedules for specific domains nor did I find the time tables)

2/I'm afraid that if I don't end up in the 35% in my class,I would have to come back to Tunisia and be unemployed or go private since I don't think public tunisian schools offer equivalence degrees and I don't think private unis give scolarships to students who sign up a year after they passed the baccalaureat 

(My parents said they're fine with paying 19000 DT a year on top of the living expenses which are not accounted for in the scolarship but I'm personally not ok with that)

3/Weather is a major downgrade from Tunisia

4/I would literally have to decide in the  next 2 days since I would have to confirm soon to the agency I'm going with so that they can start the visa process( I have to be in Malaysia the 5th of September) and if that were so I wouldn't be able to go any public school and filling the tawjih page would be useless

6/I'm not sure if either a Malaysian or Chinese degree are useful on the international scale

7/From posts I've seen, the main demographic of the students in the uni are Chinese/Malaysians of Chinese ethnicities with a minority of Africans and middle easterners so I think it would be harder to socialize since everyone would be kept to their communities

our national anthem says

'O defenders of the homeland!  
Rally around to the glory of our time!  
The blood surges in our veins,  
We die for the sake of our land.'

**WE are the defenders of the homeland. not just the army.**

'No place for betrayers in Tunisia,  
Only for those who defend her!''

even if our own goverment is betraying Tunisia, we shouldn't.

it really doesn't matter if you've never stepped foot out of Tunisia, if u only visit Tunisia during breaks, or if you've never stepped foot in it.

*if the blood that surges in ur veins is tunisian, it should be boiling.*

it should be boiling because ur country is going downhill, it should be boiling because ur president is a traitor, it should be boiling because ur goverment betrayed u, it should be boiling because u- ***WE deserve better.***

**we.** the babies,the toddlers,the children, the teens,the young adults, the grown adults and the elderly.

* we deserve to start a beautiful life in Tunisia
* we deserve to live a beautiful life in Tunisia
* we deserve to study in Tunisia
* we deserve to work in Tunisia
* we deserve to party in Tunisia
* we deserve to be happy in Tunisia

**TUNISIA,** the land of sun-drenched shores and ancient whispers, the land that magically weaved together a magical tapestry of Amazigh, Arab, Mediterranean, and African influences, the land of bright faces and enchanting smiles, the land where the most elegant dialect is spoken, the land of beauty, beauty in it's archetecture and natural sites, beauty in it's people inside and out. the land of strong communities and beautiful traditions mixed with modernity. the land that stands for Palestine and stands for freedom.

**TUNISIA,** the land that stands as a testament of a land that deserves better.

please don't let it become the land that everyone is trying to flee from, make it the land they want to flee to.

the last Arab spring? it didn't end up well. i think that's because after Ben Ali ran away, people let thier guard down, and everything got out of hand. not because we aren't strong, just because we weren't prepared. can we be this time?

why do i not like KS? pls just wake up, he's not working with or for us, just against us if anything (the only conspirancy theory thatt i've truly beileved is that france is still controling tunis. how? take a wild guess.) i'm not trying to be rude, may Allah guide him,and guide me, and guide us all, but it's only gonna go down from here if he stays in power.

think back to ur best memories in Tunis.

think about the memories u want to make in Tunis.

think about all the people u love in Tunis.

think about all the people u love that u want to come back to Tunis.

think about all the things u love about Tunis.

think about all the things u want to improve about Tunis.

think about how amazing it would be to have a better Tunis.

now let me ask you a question, are you willing for all of this to be destroyed, to slip away. *to be stolen?*

by a man that swore on the Quran (whether ur Muslim or not, this should outrage u, nobody should swear on a holy book and then lie) to protect the constitution and then made his own?

by a man who just lies?

by the goverment he leads?

have you lost hope?

believe me when i say that i don't blame you. not for a second.

ur a human. so am i. i know what it's like to lose grip of hope and fall into desperation.

but i beg u, give urself a litle push, try to have a sliver of hope - a drop even.

give this message a chance.

give urself a chance.

give Tunisia one more chance.

if u think Tunisians have inflicted this upon themselves by not voting, I understand where ur coming from, but i hope u can understand that only god knows what they were going through, and what they were thinking. assume the best of ur brothers and sisters and give them one more chance.

we just need to give orselves a chance.

In the heart of every struggle lies the ember of hope, flickering yet unyielding. Tunisia, it's journey has been fraught with challenges, but within it resides the spirit of resilience that ignited a revolution. Remember that *change is often born from the darkest moments; it thrives in the perseverance of those who dare to dream of a brighter future.*

When the weight of despair feels heavy, look around and see the strength in unity. Every voice raised in solidarity, every act of courage, brings you one step closer to the homeland you envision—a place where justice, freedom, and opportunity flourish for all. This is not the time to give up, but to rise again, to fight with renewed vigor for the dreams that once sparked your passion.

Take a moment to breathe deeply, to remember why you should start this journey. Your hopes are valid, your struggles are real, and your fight is worth every ounce of energy.

*Hold on to each other, lift each other up, and together, reclaim the promise of Tunisia.*

\*\*\*

only god knows who's reading this. u may be standing with KS in fear of something, or in hope of a reward. and for that... i don't judge you. not for a second. i believe u might be doing that as a survival instinct almost. **it feels like 'every man for themselves' right now and i know that, BUT**

in a world that often champions the “every man for himself” mentality, it’s time to awaken to the strength that comes from unity and shared purpose. true power lies not in isolation, but in the collective spirit that binds us together. When we lift each other up, we create a force that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

imagine a Tunisia where neighbors support one another, where struggles are shared, and victories are celebrated together. this shift from self-interest to solidarity transforms not only communities but also individuals. by standing together, we amplify our voices, harness our diverse strengths, and cultivate resilience in the face of adversity.

when we fight for each other, we forge connections that break down barriers and build trust. it empowers us to advocate for change, to hold each other accountable, and to envision a future where every individual thrives. it will be 100x more benefitial in the end.

***now is the time to stand shoulder to shoulder, to fight for one another, and to build a homeland where everyone’s dreams can flourish. Together, we are unstoppable.***

\*\*\*

(this part is for my Muslims, but if ur not Muslim ur ofcourse welcome and encouraged to read)

In times of hardship, it is vital for us to remember the strength we draw from our unity and faith. Allah (SWT) reminds us in the Quran, “And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided” (Surah Al-Imran, 3:103). Together, we can face any challenge that comes our way.

We must hold on to hope, for Allah promises relief after hardship. He says, “Indeed, with hardship comes ease” (Surah Ash-Sharh, 94:6). This beautiful reminder encourages us to stay steadfast, knowing that every trial we face is a step toward the relief and freedom we seek.

As we navigate these turbulent times, let us remember the words of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, while there is good in both. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel powerless.”

No matter how difficult our circumstances may seem, we must not lose hope. Allah (SWT) is always with us, and He hears our prayers. As He assures us in the Quran, “And your Lord says, 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you'” (Surah Ghafir, 40:60). Let us raise our voices in prayer and stand firm in our commitment to justice and freedom.

After every storm, the sun will shine again. In these moments of darkness, let us be the light for one another, fostering love, support, and solidarity. Our faith and resilience will guide us through.

May Allah grant us strength, patience, and ultimate victory. Ameen.

Tunisia,places to visit,I(F) had the weirdest and cringiest interaction with an anime stuff vendor and I wanna address it,"It happened in a mall, where we, two sisters (F) spend most the day visiting ALL the places and I had no problem with any vendor ( I bought a lot of stuff that really suited my budged and I felt they're well-priced)
Until I stand over an anime stand where he bought cool anime stuff (ez). My sister wanted to buy a gift for her Luffy-fan friend and she liked a key chain of luffy's hat which was crochet and didnt pass 4cm in diameter, but when she khew they were for 30dt, we thought it was overpriced (we thought it shouldnt pass 20dt as a MAX to support the bussiness but really it should've been 10dt) and we thanked the guy and just walked away peacefully 
Yet the guy still called for us saying ""what do u think the price was?"" In a really dry tone and piercing eyes. My sister didny understand the situation and she just replied while she s joking (forgot wht she said but it was cool, no insult). She just didnt understand him and since he was addressing her, I got to focus on his attitude, tone and body language more and HE DID NOT STOP LOOKING AT HER, IT WAS SUPER CREEPY
when we got out, I explained to her the real reason why he called us back and she thought that he s gonna price it down 

TL,DDR: isnt this how business works? If the pricing is quite suitable for you, you buy unless just walk away?
Then why was he so attacking and personal? 
I could assume it was a long day for him but m  sure he was build that way sadly

Tunisia,places to visit,Mother wants to come to the US 6 months a year to live with me and my wife !!,"Throwaway account cause this is too personal and frankly embarrassing. I could have posted this elsewhere but wanted to get opinions from people that can relate culturally.

Sorry but it's going to be a long one. 5 years ago, I moved to the US, finished my masters degree, got married and founded a family there. For reasons that are too long to explain, around 1 year after I came, I filed a petition for my mother to get the green card (I'm the only one in the family who holds US Citizenship). Her reasoning at that time was that she wanted to come to help my brother who was also at the US and was struggling with many issues. However, he had to leave definitely the US the day before she came, so my mother had to stay with me and my wife during that time. I didn't mind her much at that time, we just had our newborn child and I thought it will be a good opportunity for her to get to know my wife more and help a little bit with the baby. But man I was so wrong.

A little context around my beloved mother: She can be the sweetest person, but she is also, and it hurt my soul to say it, one of the most cynical, controlling and narcissist person I have met. She goes above and beyond to try to control every aspect of her children's life, from who they marry, to which kind of friends they have to make. I had a lot of conflicts with her back when I was in Tunisia, and me going to the US was a way to break free. Now that she has the green card, she wants to stay 6 months a year here with us in the US, so she can be eligible to apply for naturalization after 5 years. And she made that objective her number one priority in life (I'm not exaggerating, she literally told me that). We already hosted her three times, and we reached a point where we cannot accommodate her anymore. Her being around is creating us a lot of problems. My wife can be very understanding, and she was always polite to her even when my mother was in return rude and mean. To not go deep into details, her coming is literally ruining our marriage.

Now, her next trip to the US is due very soon. I politely tried to explain to her several times before, that we cannot host her anymore and if she is so keen on getting the US citizenship, she had to find other alternatives. She started to throw a tantrum over the phone, saying how I was a bad son and it was my duty to accommodate my aging parents. I have no issue with taking care of my parents whatsoever and I know that when the day come, I will try to be there for them. But I told her that you cannot leave your house, family and everything back in Tunisia to come stay with me 6 months just because you want to pursue your dream of getting this freaking passport. She can always visit, but she cannot come and go every 6 months as she please. But of course all I'm getting is guilt-trapping from her, saying that she will come regardless and we will have to host her because I cannot leave her alone in the cold American winter.

Now I'm at a point where I don't know what to do. The amount of guilt-trapping and manipulation I got from her is so insane that I'm here questioning whether or not not letting her come is the right decision or not. I booked a flight to Tunisia, in an attempt to come there and persuade her in person to drop her crazy dream, but now I'm getting backlashes from my own family. My father, while understanding where I'm coming from, think that me coming is a bad idea and that I have to make sacrifices to accommodate my mother's desires. My sister have already a lot of problems with her and wants to stay out. I'm tempted to just surrender and let her do whatever she wants, but I know that it will cost me my wife, as she is %100 against her coming and literally threatened to leave the house if I can't stop my mother from coming. I'm really disappointed that I couldn't find support anywhere, that my own family are going to be the main reason for my divorce if I don't find a solution. And I have no idea how to stop things from happening. Am I even wrong for not letting her come ? Who knows...

**Edit**: I didn't expect that many answers. Thank you all !! She stills want to come, but now instead of staying with us she wants to rent a place to stay. I don't agree with her plan, she is old (73) and won't be able to properly take care of herself. I'm now in the boarding room at the airport on my way to Tunisia as a last attempt to try to settle this thing once and for all.","Being parents doesn’t give them the right to ruin their kid’s life, your mother needs to learn that she can’t have everything she wants in life even on the cost of her children’s life and stability and guilt tripping schemes. She’s literally crossing soooo many boundaries not to mention ruining your life literally. You need to set boundaries otherwise she’s not only ruining your marriage she’ll keep doing whatever she wants in the future and as long as u let it slide the cycle would NEVER ends.

I know she’s your mother, but now you also have another family that you’re responsible for, so act up even if it means taking some hard decisions but u need to decide if you’re gonna give up and let this continue or you’re going to put a stop to this shit show. 

Also your father “thinking you should surrender…” is merely his way of not wanting to deal with your mother’s tantrums and throwing the ball to u, he honestly needs to step up too.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1h1dwid/mother_wants_to_come_to_the_us_6_months_a_year_to/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,places to visit,"Coming to spend half a year in Tunisia, need your help","Hi reddit and its Tunisians!
I'm planning to come live there in Autumn for half a year or so and I immensely need your advice on a list of aspects. Huge thanks in advance.

1. Is €1000-1500 a month enough to live there including rent in a decent safe neighborhood close to the shoreline? I work online, don't need a job. I've checked numbeo.com and all of the such, but numbers still differ on different sources. My needs are: 1-2 time a week eat-out (nowhere too fancy tho); 2-bedroom (or spacious 1-bedroom) flat in a nice hood; occasional sightseeing tours etc; good unlimited internet both at home and mobile; fine products to cook at home; maybe a couple of low-cost city breaks in Paris and other nearest cheap-to-reach European cities.
2. Which city would you recommend for that? Non-conservative, not too noisy and hustling, but with some fun places to go from time to time to meet local and foreing people and do something.
3. Is Tunisian youth open to foreigners and communication? How close is the community?
4. The eternal safety question. Pov: I'm a 26 yo pale-white long-haired bloke with a couple piercings, tattoos and the such, quite informal I would say. How much attention and eyes am I about to catch? 😁 Like is it fine walking at night without worrying too much? (Assuming I live in a good area)
4.1. I may also come with my girlfriend, same questions about her + are we okay living together while not being married?
5. I see quite different rent prices on eg. reddit and mubawab, what should I expect with requirements in question 1? Fully-furnished ofc. 
6. How good is the situation with internet and mobile network? I need a very stable communication because I use video calls all the time for work. Is it possible to get a plan with unlimited data? How much is it gonna cost me? Both home and mobile, please.
7. How safe is the country in the rural areas? Like if we talk about hiking, visiting the villages, the Sahara tours and so on
8. How bad is it with the traffic and driving style and how insensible is it of me to hire a motorbike?
9. How serious is the situation with the revolution, unrests and political instability? Are the police dangerous to interact with? Is there anything like authoritarian regime or so? Maybe any topics to avoid bringing up when talking to locals?
10. Any national hobbies/interests/cultural aspects to dive in or be ready for beforehand? Like what Tunisians love and admire etc.
11. I know English is not popular there, but I can speak a little French. Is enhancing the latter enough or learning key Arabic is my only way?

Huge thanks for answering, you'll help me a ton! Any other thoughts and details are very welcome 🙃","you have too many questions im answering the first one

I would not consider visiting places deemed dangerous by my government if I didn't think there was a possibility that the advice is wrong. I have no intention of disrespecting Tunisia or Tunisians.

Tunisia,places to visit,Visiting this December. What do you think of this itinerary?,"Hi everyone,

I will be visiting Tunisia for 10 days this December and the below is my itinerary. After extensive research I came to the conclusion that I will be using mostly '*louages*' to travel between a place and another. I travelled to North African countries in the past and I also know that life is usually slow paced so I'm not hassling much regarding accommodation as will be traveling during a relatively low season period. I consider myself as a slow traveller as well so won't be rushing (*as long as I'm not late for my flight lol*)

I will be landing early afternoon in Tunis airport and the plan is to get downtown, get a 'louage' and start making my way south-bound. My plan is to arrive somewhere close to Douz and explore the area of Qibili, Chott el Djerid and Tozeur. Probably I would be required to change louage at Kairouan were I wouldn't mind staying an overnight there.

When I eventually arrive at Douz area, I will dedicate 3 days to explore the area and then head north directly to Tunis were I will be spending my last 3 days there to visit Sidi Bou Said, Tunis Medina and Roman/Byzantine archaeological sites. Not interested in going to Tattoonie area and Star Wars sets. Don't think it's worth the time.

Dunno if someone can answer this but what route should I take with the louages to arrive in Douz area? Does Tunis - Kairouan - Douz make sense or I'm missing something? I'm interested in outdoor, hiking, desert, food, culture. Not interested in congested cities and luxury resorts.

Any tips are highly appreciated. Can't wait to visit the country!

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France

* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites.

Tunisia,places to visit,Does Tunisia want high spending tourists?,"I am following r/tunisia and from time to time there are post and comments about cheap tourists (spending only <300€ per stay etc.). Does Tunisia really want to have high spending tourists?

For example:  
2 people, 1 week, 5 Star hotel, flights included from Munich/Germany

1100€ Tunisia --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187)

1300€ Turkey --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209)

Price difference is 200€.

I have good friends from Tunisia that I visited 4 times over the last years. I stayed at their place (Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia) not a hotel (I like it much more, you get to know the people/country). My friends have some contacts so sometimes we went to hotel beaches. The waiters were not very motivated and we had to wait a lot for drinks/food/service etc.  
The same at some restaurants (not all of course), even pricy ones like this in sousse (https://maps.app.goo.gl/SW5SoChbQ26W72788). Sometimes you sit at your table and have to wait for 10-20min until somebody comes, takes orders etc. If you dont give them signals the maybe never come idk. As a tourist I want to spend money but the seemed like the dont want to make buisness.

So why should a (high spending) german tourist come to Tunisia and not Turkey (great service, modern hotels)? Most tourists rather spend 200€ more and go to Turkey for example.

Tunisia has great food, culture, medias etc. but I dont really see the goal to attract high spending tourists.

PS: I really like the country and will come back this year to visit.



","Actually I think Tunisia should manage how tourists spend their money. Hotels are just a blackhole: they do not pay that much taxes, they do not pay their employees that well, they get benefits on water, electricity and subsidiary goods like flour, sugar, goods...

I think Tunisia should rather invest in transportation so that tourists could easily move in the country and actively contribute to the economy by interacting directly with the locals and not by staying in all inclusive hotel for two weeks.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1asbqn2/does_tunisia_want_high_spending_tourists/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia",General,en
Tunisia,places to visit,My trip to tunis as a Libyan ,"كانت هذه المرة الثانية التي أزور فيها تونس بمفردي كشاب يبلغ من العمر 23 عاماً، أما المرة الأولى فكانت مع والديّ، إذ كان على والدي حضور اجتماع عمل، وكنت حينها في السابعة عشرة من عمري، ولم أرَ منها الكثير. أما هذه المرة فقد تجولت في الشوارع والتقطت صوراً لكل باب قديم في “المدينة العتيقة”.

كنت أمشي وأقع في حب كل خطوة أخطوها، وأنا أرى كل درجات المشاعر على وجوه الناس، وكيف كانوا جميعاً بهذا الجمال. خضت محادثات طويلة مع غرباء وسائقي التاكسي، وكانوا جميعاً مثقفين ولطفاء. لقد زرت العديد من البلدان، وهذا هو ما جعلني أعشق تونس، كانت مختلفة، شعرت بسلام وهدوء، ومشاعر مكثفة في آنٍ واحد. عدت إلى بلدي منذ أسبوعين، وما زلت أشتاق إليها بطريقة غريبة، وكأنني تركت جزءاً مني هناك.

كل ما فعلته كان التجول وزيارة بعض الأماكن القديمة. كما نصحني أحدهم بزيارة “أبواب تونس السبعة”، مثل باب البحر، وباب سويقة، وغيرها. أردت فقط أن أعبر عن حبي الكبير لأهل هذا البلد الجميل، ومدى اشتياقي إليه. لقد كتبت قصيدة عنه، وسأكون سعيداً بمشاركتها إذا كان هناك من يرغب في قراءتها.

This was my second time going to Tunis on my own as a 23 years old guy, the first one was with my parents since my father had to go for a work meeting, i was 17 at the time so I haven’t seen much of it, but this time i roamed the streets and i took pictures of every single old door in the “old city” 
I was walking around falling in love with every step i take as i’m seeing all shades of emotions on people’s faces, and how they were all so beautiful, i’ve had enormous conversations with strangers and Taxi drivers and they were all so educated and kind, i have been to a lot of countries and this is what made me fall in love with Tunis, it was different it felt peaceful and different and intense, i got back home two weeks ago and i still miss it in a strange way it feels like i left a piece of me there, all i did was walking and visiting some old places, also someone advised me to see “ the seven doors of Tunis, bab al bahr, bab soueeqa ,etc , i just want to say how much i love the people of this beautiful country and how much i miss it, i even wrote a poem about it so here it is if someone is interested in reading it ","https://preview.redd.it/cfyfnot3isyd1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adfc28bb8492febbfe2a3eb83e7a4be4ffdd0ce6

Tunisia,places to visit,Sahara from Douz vs Djerba?,"Sorry for another naïve tourist post. I am looking to visit Tunisia in December, and I am thinking to do an overnight trip in either Douz or Djerba, please help me to decide. I am leaning a little bit towards Douz for now.

I am aware of lots of Star War site in Tunisia, personally not a fan but I don’t dislike them, it’s an non-factor for me. I do like unique looking structure or site though like Tataouine.

My main interest is to have an authentic experience, you know, have a little camel ride for 2 or 3 hours, big sand dune, stay in the desert overnight and gather around campfire, as I will be traveling myself, it’d be the best to be grouped with other traveller. Chott el djerid in pink looks great from Google pic, wonder if there are enough water when I am there?

I can’t drive myself but I reckon both places should be easily reachable from Tunis through bus or shared taxi? Also the price seems bit steep if I pre-book online, should I arrange on the spot in Douz or Djerba?

Will have 11 days of the whole trip (9 full days), I plan to visit also Tunis, Kairouen, Hammanmat etc.

I live in Japan, I like taking videos and Pictures and I certainly know a lot of stuff about the country, first hand experience kind of knowledge. 
I was wondering if as Tunisians who mostly hate Cringe and Majber bullshit that we see on a daily basis on social media and Media in general, would you be interested in watching a breath of fresh air of a dude talking with Japanese people and foreigners in Japan and visiting places. 
I am in the process of starting soon, but I wanted to ask either way to see if this might interest Tunisians especially the “ مثقفون"" because I am not targeting “المجبر الجهال"" . 
Topics would range from Japanese authentic experiences to Japanese people opinions and foreigners opinions , a few comedy sketches, and informational shorts etc . 

Let me know if this is something that interests you.

I know being PC is boring and uncool for us Tunisians, but it's how the business works.

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do.

As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful

Tunisia,recommended itineraries,Tunisia tour itinerary feedback,"Hello everyone,

Looking for some feedback/recommendations for my itinerary in [Tunis](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g293758-Tunis_Tunis_Governorate-Vacations.html)ia. Planning to visit in the first week of Jan 2025.

Day 1: Arrive in Tunis late in the evening

Day 2: Sightseeing in Tunis - Medina, Bardo Museum

Day 3: Leave for a desert tour. Cover El Jem, Kairouan on the way to Tozeur for a night stay

Day 4: Chott El Jerid and Star Wars set. Stay overnight in a desert camp

Day 5: Return to Tunis via Matmata

Day 6: Day trip to Carthage and Sidi Bousaid

Day 7: Fly out late afternoon from Tunis

A couple of questions:

1. Does this plan seem doable or are there any concerns? I'll be traveling with my wife (no kids)
2. Are we missing any major sights/spots in this itinerary?
3. We are looking to hire a private [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g293753-Tunisia.html) for the desert tour. Any recommendations for reputed and reliable tour operators?
4. Lastly, we are planning to do this in the first week of Jan. Is that a good time to be in Tunisia?

Any other feedback/recommendations are most welcome.

Tunisia,recommended itineraries,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

PS: u/saihi We confirmed the fact about no-smoking signs in the restaurants and being offered and ashtray XD","Good to hear that you liked it

Tunisia,recommended itineraries,Seeking advice for a 7 day trip... in December,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a guy from Singapore who will be visiting in mid-December with my brother. Currently we study in France and the UK. We both love history and archaeology (museums, material culture, visiting sites), trying new food, and meeting new people to learn and exchange information. My brother is also into wildlife photography, although I suppose December is off-season.

 Currently, we're thinking of flying into (and maybe out of?) Tunis. Unfortunately neither of us drive, but we're down to catch a bus/louage/taxi/train as needed. 

I had this itinerary in mind, but wanted to check in with the far more knowledgeable people over here if this seemed like a doable plan, or if there are improvements that could be made! 

**Day 1:** Fly into Tunis; see the Bardo Museum + Medina

**Day 2:**  Day trip to Sidi-bou-Saïd 

**Day 3:** Day trip to Carthage

**Day 4:** Day trip to Dougga 

**Day 5:** Louage (?) to Sousse, see Archaeological Museum

**Day 6:** Day trip to Kairouan 

**Day 7:** Day trip to El Jem. 

**Day 8:** Fly out of Monastir (?) 

A few questions. 

1: As you can see, we are basing ourselves in Tunis for four nights and Sousse for three - would you recommend this? 

2: Are there places to see wildlife in winter? The Ichkeul National Park looks lovely but seems out of the way, and possibly not that active in December. 

3:  What would you suggest we do in Tunis/Sousse in the evenings/nights? I'd love to check out any art centers or any interesting things that are going on. 

4: Anything food-wise that's underrated which I should try? I love the few times I've tried Tunisian food here in France, but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg.

5: What would you recommend I read or watch to learn about Tunisia? Academic books are fine, blogs are wonderful. My French is not fantastic, and neither my brother or I speak Arabic, so sadly English resources are preferable. 

Thanks in advance to everybody! I hope one day I can repay back anything I've learnt here - if you have any questions about Singapore, or England/Paris where we studied/are studying, for instance, I would be happy to have them. 

P.S. /u/scafidi_travels has produced such amazing resources! His playlists are so in-depth, but I don't have a good sense of how these fit into an itinerary where I won't rent a car. 

Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm doing anything stupid!

Tunisia,recommended itineraries,Visiting Tunisia for the first time! Hoping for travel recommendations.,"Hi r/Tunisia. Hope you're all finding balance and strength throughout the pandemic.

My fiancé and I are traveling to Tunisia from Montréal later this month. Our itinerary has us in Tunis for a few days, then Djerba, then a Sahara tour, and then back in Tunis to close it all out. We'll be in the country for ten days total. 

I've got a couple specific (maybe weird?) questions that I'm hoping you could answer. Any tips would be massively appreciated.

1) Places to see live music in Tunis. In particular, I'm a huge fan of Anouar Brahem, the Tunisian oud player, so traditional music would be amazing. But any music really (assuming the pandemic hasn't shut all that down).

2) Seafood restaurants in Tunis or Djerba. Not looking for anything fancy, but ideally somewhere that serves octopus. Love octopus.

3) Somewhere where I can buy or develop 35mm film. I'll be taking photos during the trip and would prefer to have them developed in Tunis rather than risk the negatives being scanned at the airport. Somewhere that sells old vintage cameras would be a bonus!

4) Places to buy vinyl records?

5) Tips on getting a PCR test done in Tunis. I tried using the booking website but it seems like we need to either call or visit in person, rather than book online. If anyone can point us to the a reliable testing centre in Tunis it'd be super helpful.

4) And just food recommendations in general, or places in Tunis and Djerba that you think fly under the radar. Or general travel tips/precautions that we should know.

Tunisia,visa requirements,Visa/TLS: funding requirements for internship in French.," Hello,

I have been accepted to study a master's program in France. I have also been awarded a scholarship of 4000 euros for a 7-month period, along with a minimum gratification for a 4 or 5-month internship. However, the university did not specify the exact amount of the internship gratification in the financial certification (The minimum gratification for a 4 or 5-month internship is mentioned).

My question is: Would TLS accept this certification, or does the university need to mention the exact amount of the internship gratification to fulfill the 7,400 euros requirement for obtaining a 1-year visa?

Currently, I have 1500 euros with me to take to France. Can the minimum gratification for the internship mentioned in the financial certification justify the missing 2000 euros needed to meet the funding requirement required by TLS?

Thank you in advance for your help.","TLS is not authority. They simply transfer the documents to the consulate who actually make a decision.

I am thinking of quitting my job and getting a visa in Spain. I know that you get 3 months to find a new job and I am negotiating a remote one. But to speed up the process, I will need to get my visa through my bf first then switch to DNV after having worked for 3 months. I am only concerned about whether it would be problematic to apply for the VISA after having quit or it wouldn’t matter as long as my blue card is valid.

Getting the PR in Germany while I don’t plan to live there doesn’t make too much sense to me. But neither does staying for at least three to four years to get the citizenship. If I don’t identify with the society, Improving the language, then applying and waiting for at least a year to get it seems life a waste of my life. I do not share the values of this country. Also it makes sense to spend one more year or so in another country where I don’t absolutely hate my life.

Original post: I have been living in Germany for a while now and had enough. To be fair, I do not speak the language fluently so this could potentially have tinted my experience though I highly doubt it. I do understand German kinda well, but I have no passion for the language and hence couldn’t get myself to invest in getting to a higher level than A2/B1. This didn’t stop me from making close German friends and having amazing friendships. However, I have always felt that something was missing. I have done some reflection and realized am not truly living but rather surviving and with the latest events unfolding, I can’t help but feel that I am living a life against my values. 

  
Yes, I have the blue card, I am getting paid well above average and I even qualify for the permanent residency in a couple of months. But I would need to take lessons and sit for the German exam and wait for months till my application is processed. I am so done with this system though. You get a lot of money on paper but you end up with peanuts in your account. Half of it goes towards taxes that don’t even pay your pension but that of the generation before you or to sponsor nonsensical war that you can‘t even protest about openly. 

You pay shit ton of money for insurance but then have to wait months to get an appointment. You are welcome as long as you are productive, but if you want to venture with a business or take a break from work? Too bad, you’ll be kicked out in 3months. Can’t even get a freaking therapist that is not asking for at least 150 euros per session (Mental health in capitalist system is a whole other topics though )

I also want to try a different career, but again as I mentioned the system is not made for you to do so. And nothing pays as wel as IT here without german requirements here anyway.

Please do not tell me to suck it up till getting the PR. I know that it’s the common track for tunisians to just work in Germany and “sacrifice” till getting the passport, and god knows I tried to do this, but hell am not willing to waste anymore of my life on this. I am not willing to waste brain power on the language. I can literally die tomorrow and all of this time would have been for nothing. This whole blue card thing feels like modern slavery, and with everything going on in the world, Germany will have to work up a miracle to keep it’s position of power. 

Anyone has similar or a different take? Or someone who broke free from this withiut sacrificing their whole youth?

What are your thoughts/ advice on the topic?

","I am not in Germany but allow me to say this... While I don't support falling into the sunk cost fallacy, I advise you to weigh the pros and cons of your decision and ask yourself whether giving up now is worthwhile. In five years, which decision will you be glad you made: dropping it now after years of sacrifice, or persevering to get the PR?

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,visa requirements,"My Experience with AIESEC: Both as a Member and as Someone Who Went Abroad Through Them

","Hi everyone,

As mentioned in the title, I’m here to share my full experience with AIESEC—both as a member and as someone who participated in their program abroad. My goal is to help you make an informed decision before engaging with them.

# As a Professional

Last year, I decided to go abroad with AIESEC for a market research position in Istanbul starting in January 2024. Here’s a breakdown of my journey:

* **Initial Process**: I had interviews with both AIESEC Tunisia and Istanbul. After being accepted, I paid an initiation fee of **230 TND** for the opportunity.
* **Expenses**: Beyond the initiation fee, here’s a breakdown of the other costs I incurred:
   * **Flight ticket**: 700 TND
   * **Rent contract fees (notarized)**: 400 TND
   * **Real estate agent fees**: 400 TND
   * **Monthly rent**: 800 TND
   * **Deposit fees**: 800 TND
   * **Residence permit fees**: 800 TND
   * **Insurance for residency process**: Additional cost.
   * **Visa processing expenses**: I had to travel to the capital for this, which wasn’t necessary since Turkey allows 3 months of visa-free travel. You can handle visa status changes directly in Turkey—don’t let them misguide you and waste your money.

**Total: A LOT more than expected due to hidden costs AIESEC Istanbul never disclosed.**

* **The Job**: Upon arriving, I discovered that the job description didn’t match reality. I felt stuck in a poorly managed role that was completely different from what was promised. Despite pushing through for 3 months, the company terminated my contract due to “lack of performance”—even though they themselves failed to honor the contract’s terms.
* **AIESEC’s Response**: I contacted AIESEC Tunisia, Istanbul, and their international department. None of them offered a logical solution. Instead, they proposed a new position as a graphic designer in another state—requiring me to pay *again* for new contract fees, real estate agent fees, and other relocation costs. After everything I had already spent, I couldn’t afford to start over, so I treated the trip as a vacation and returned home.

# As a Member

Being a member of AIESEC was another disappointment. Here’s what I experienced:

* The team was poorly organized and overly focused on social events. They scheduled conferences every 3 months, each costing around **150 TND** with **zero added value**.
* They pressured members to buy their merchandise, attend events, and dedicate excessive time (up to 4 meetings a week) to discuss things that felt unproductive.
* The entire experience was unprofessional, and the environment felt like a group of aimless kids rather than a serious organization.

# My Takeaway

Whether as a professional or a member, AIESEC offered me **zero added value**. They were careless, disorganized, and didn’t provide support when issues arose.

This is just my personal experience. If you’ve had a different one, feel free to share. But if you’re considering joining AIESEC, I hope this post helps you make an informed choice.",Back in my time AIESEC was known to be a dating space more than an association and I guess that haven't changed because they milk you dry ,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1h5yvf7/my_experience_with_aiesec_both_as_a_member_and_as/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,visa requirements,seeking advice on how to regularize my status in France.,"as a tunisian 21 , In May, i obtained a short-term visa for Portugal to participate in a six-day Erasmus seminar. After completing the seminar, my family advised me not to return to my home country due to personal circumstances and to look for opportunities in France instead. I then flew from Porto to Nantes and have been staying with my cousin in Angers since then.

Unfortunately, my visa has expired, and I now find myself without legal status in France. I wish to regularize my situation, continue my studies, or find suitable employment here.

Is it possible to renew or change my expired Portuguese visa to a French visa or residence permit while staying in France? What are the steps and required documents to obtain a student permit in France? Are there any organizations or specialized lawyers who could assist me in my process? Has anyone been in a similar situation and could share their experience?


","I am afraid that short term you can’t fix this for two reasons :
* Application for Visas (Short and Long term) only have to be submitted from Tunisia.
* If you apply from Tunisia you will be denied because you overstayed your last Visa.


Long term you can, there are multiple options, but it’s not a seemless process and it can be long.


Regardless of your legal status you still can enroll into University in France, Residence Permit is not a requirement nor checked for Studies.


For other readers: please do not overstay your visas, if you got a visa and showed your good intentions, your chances of having your following applications short and long term are significantly higher.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ebq849/seeking_advice_on_how_to_regularize_my_status_in/,"Unknown, Tunis",Inquiry,en

Tunisia,visa requirements,[GUIDE] How I Emigrated And Gained Citizenship Abroad,"I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments on here and other Magrebi subs talking about how to ""get out"" of the country and live abroad. I grew up in a mixed household and had two Magrebi passports before I turned 18 and most people in my community have traveled, worked and some emigrated. Now I wanted to share what I have learned with this community in hopes of helping others who want to do the same.

# Completing Secondary Education: The Journey Begins

When I completed my secondary education I became qualified to apply to America's [Diversity Immigrant Visa Program](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-eligibility/green-card-through-the-diversity-immigrant-visa-program) which is by far the easiest way to emigrate. The application is free and you can reapply **every year** until you win. The only requirement is you have a passport and completed some form of secondary education. I was also attending University but I kept the necessary documents saved and placed an annual reminder on my calendar which told me reapply every year on [October 5th when the application opens up](https://dvprogram.state.gov/). A few of my friends won while they were still completing their undergraduate degrees and transferred to American Universities. I had yet to win so I looked for more opportunities.

# Graduating University: First Time Abroad

In my 4th year of University I began aggressively applying to jobs abroad. I applied to jobs all over the world but 90% of my applications were to positions in the Khaleej because [they allow you to gain residency if you find employment](https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/government/2022/04/27/applying-for-a-uae-visa-heres-how-to-get-residency-in-dubai-and-abu-dhabi/) and don't tax your income. This was important to me since my primary reason for seeking employment abroad was to make more money.

From my experience the best platforms to apply for jobs are LinkedIn, [Bayt.com](https://bayt.com/) and Stack Overflow if you're in tech. I eventually got a good job offer in the UAE and moved Dubai to start my new career. I opened a bank as soon as I had my National ID card so I wouldn't have to worry about the capital flight restrictions anymore. I also made the decision to live **incredibly frugally** because my goal was to pursue graduate studies in Canada (more on why later). I studied and took the [TOFEL](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html) and [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) exams since they are necessary for both education and immigration purposes. Meanwhile I kept applying to the American DV lottery since it would still be the fastest way to get permanent residency.

# Graduate Studies: Moving to Canada

After about 2 years I had saved enough money to begin studying in Canada. While education in Canada is not as expensive as the United States it is still very expensive so knowing **where** to apply is very important. From my research the following Universities offer the best tuition rates for international students:

1. Memorial University of Newfoundland
2. University of Manitoba
3. University of Regina
4. Simon Fraser University
5. University of Saskatchewan
6. University of Calgary
7. Dalhousie University

In addition to the low tuition costs they are also located in inexpensive cities which is equally important. The reason I choose Canada as my destination for graduate studies is because after you complete a Master's degree in Canada, you are eligible for a [Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html) which allows you to work in Canada for a duration equivalent to the length of your program (3 years max). I enrolled in my two year graduate program and began my graduate studies in Canada. I made sure to network during this time and attended every career fair regardless if it was for undergraduate student or graduate students. I kept my CV up to date and used LinkedIn strategically to network with hiring managers. Meanwhile I continued to apply to the American DV lottery.

# Finishing Master Degree: Gaining PR in Canada

After graduating from my Master program I found a job and applied for the PGWP so I could remain in Canada. After a year of working in Canada I became eligible to gain permanent residency (PR) via the  [Canadian Experience Class (CEC) immigration program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/canadian-experience-class.html). The CEC makes it very easy for educated and skilled foreigners to gain PR in Canada. It's a point based program so the more ""qualified"" you are the easier it is for you to gain PR. There are many nuances to the  Canadian Experience Class (CEC) but here are the main things the program looks for:

* Work Experience (Canadian experience preferred)
* Language Proficiency (IELTS scores)
* Education (Canadian education preferred)
* Age (Younger people preferred)

In general if you completed your education in Canada and worked in Canada then you are a **very strong** candidate for Canadian residency. This was my case so I gained permanent residency after being on a PGWP for about two years. I continued to apply to the American DV lottery the whole time.

# Becoming Canadian Citizen: First Foreign Passport

After living in Canada for three years I became eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. I gathered the necessary documents, completed [Form CIT 0002](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/application-canadian-citizenship-adults.html) and paid the application fees. Later I completed a citizenship test which tests your knowledge of Canada's history, values, institutions, rights etc.. After passing the test I attended a Citizenship Ceremony and received my Certificate of Canadian Citizenship which allowed me to get my Canadian passport. By this time I had lived in Canada for 6 years and thought I would have lived here the rest of my life but something interesting happened: I won American DV lottery.

# Moving To America: The Journey Continues

I had kept applying the the American DV lottery because I saw it as a form of insurance in case one of my applications was denied or if my immigration to Canada ran into issues. I was ready to stop since I finally had my Canadian citizenship but on May 6th I received notification that I won the DV lottery. Since I work in tech I feel the United States will be a better place for me to work and many of my Canadian colleagues had already move to the United States for higher paying jobs. I wasn't interested in going through the H1-B visa to PR process but now that I can skip ahead to the PR I'm going to go for it. I submitted all the necessary documents and once I have my Green Card I'll being applying to jobs in the United States. I'm really excited to see what the future has in store for me!

# Final Thoughts

Like I said from the start my goal was to write about my journey to help people on here learn more about what opportunities are out there and show it's no that hard to ""get out"" if you really want. I would say my main takeaways are the following:

* **Be Persistent.** It took 6 years for me to gain my Canadian citizenship and 12 years to win the American DV lottery. If you aren't ready to keep trying then you shouldn't bother starting.
* **Pursue Multiple Paths.** If you want to go abroad you need to pursue multiple options at once because you never know which one will work out. Look for education opportunities, work opportunities and other opportunities like the American DV lottery.
* **Education is King.** The more educated you are the easier it is to move abroad. Completing your secondary education allows you to apply for the American DV lottery. The TOFEL and IELTS are necessary for graduate studies and PR applications. Canada's point based system favors more educated and skilled people so you will always have a way into Canada if you're educated and skilled.

If anyone would like more information I am happy to answer question and provide more information about my journey. I have tried to give as much information as possible while still maintaining some privacy so forgive me if I have been too cryptic.

Tunisia,visa requirements,Interfaith religious marriage,"Hello fellow redditors,

I come to you with a very personal question regarding my situation.

We partner and I would like to get married in Tunisia.

I am a non-muslim french and she's a Muslim Algerian. Because of traditions and beliefs it is important for her family that we do a religious marriage.

Tunisia seems like a good place to do so as we both like the country and it is easier for everyone to travel there, i.e., no visa required for both families. 

In France it is quite common to see a non religious person marrying a catholic one, if the couple is ok with it so is the priest marrying them.

I am wondering if the same could happen in Tunisia or if I must convert to Islam beforehand. 

Thanks a lot,

Cheers !","I'm not a Tunisian Law nor Islamic Law specialist so take this with a grain of salt, but as far as I'm aware you could get married in Tunisia without converting but that wouldn't be considered a 'religious marriage'  and it would be a civil contract of marriage (the same you would get in France).

I'm not a faqih but the general position of Sunni Islam Fiqh is that an Islamic marriage contract won't be valid if the groom is not Muslim. If you want your marriage to be recognized in the eyes of God you will have to convert.",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/woszu7/interfaith_religious_marriage/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Me (German) and my wife ( Tunisian) gonna visit Malaysia in 3 weeks. We searched for a country where she can go without visa. Do you guys know by any chance, which requirements you need to enter the country? For me, I just need the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card. I guess that my wife needs it too? Does anybody know the requirements to enter the country as a Tunisian citizen? She will fly from Tunisian and I from Germany, so we will meet there.

Tunisia,visa requirements,A Student who prepared his own Visa application To Germany ,"I am looking for a student who has prepared all the necessary documents without any agency. The purpose is to understand the **details** of the process of gathering the required documents. Now, everyone can access the Embassy’s website and find the necessary documents—it's easy. But the real issue is how to obtain the documents. For example:

* **The Blocked Account**: It is easy to say that you need to open a blocked account, but the real issue is how? After doing some research, I found out that we need to access the Fintiba app and create an account. Yet, I still can’t figure out how to deal with the central bank to transfer the money. What are the required documents to be eligible to transfer money from Tunisia to Fintiba? How do I submit the request?
* **The University Application**: Another required document. After doing a lot of research, I found out that agencies contact specific universities that give easy acceptance letters accepted by the embassy for the visa (they're not popular universities). But how do I find these? And what documents do I need to provide besides my baccalaureate certificate and CV? What are the dates to apply? Are there specific periods? Agencies get instant acceptance letters starting from the date you start working with them to complete the dossier as soon as possible. How long do I have to wait to get a response?
* **Language School Payment**: How do I pay the language school if I am going to do a German language program? How do I deal with the central bank again?
* **Visa Application**: I have found out that the visa application is done through TLS, but how do I present the required documents exactly?
* **Rendezvous Timing**: Is the rendezvous booked before I gather the documents or after? I heard that I have to wait for very long periods.
* **Appointment Expectations**: What should I expect when having the appointment? How should I prepare? What am I going to be asked? Do the questions ever change? In what language am I going to communicate? Am I going to talk to a Tunisian, German, or English representative?
* **Accommodation**: It is easy to say that you have to search for an apartment, but the reality is that hosts on applications like WG-Gesucht will never respond. Besides the high demand, the risk of being scammed is high. They will never respond if you contact them, even with a well-structured email or message, because we are Arab and racism is one of Germany’s characteristics or behaviors. If there is an American or European student, they will be instantly prioritized. It is nearly impossible to find a place to stay near the location where you will study the language unless you plan to live in a foyer with the language school, which will be extremely expensive.
* **Signing Contracts**: How do I sign contracts if I find an appropriate apartment? How do I make sure that it will be credible or recognized? What is the process?

It is nearly impossible to answer these questions through deep and daily research, and the list of questions is still ongoing, but I am going to limit it to the ones mentioned above. That’s literally why agencies take advantage of students in every single way. If we’re able to answer these questions, no one will need to go through agencies and pay enormous fees, along with the hidden ones like their commission in the fee of the language school they’re dealing with. If we can enroll ourselves in schools there, we will be easily saving at least 2000 EUR (it’s after a lot of questioning different agencies and their fees).

The process needs to be clear and structured for students and, most importantly, **public** because that’s what agencies are taking advantage of. Every student will eventually go to them because it’s always the same case: How do I start? What if I miss any paper? Where do I go?...

PLEASE, if you're going to simply reply with “you need to search everything and work on your own or do some effort,” **SAVE IT**.

Tunisia,visa requirements,Preparing for visa to china,"Hello everyone my first time posting here (didn't find anyone who can help me )
So I've been studying in a Chinese program (via my university here) and now that it's the last year we are required to go to china and finish the last year there (4 months language, 2months  holiday and four months pfe ) 
The thing is the Chinese university said that the visa will be for one year and we're expected to go there on the 7th of march. 
Now the problem lies with the papers and the procedure 
According to my research I don't need that much papers : -admission letter 
- jw paper 
-online visa application 
- photos and a copy of the passport 
-attestation des fonds (2500$ par an) 
That's all but unfortunately the university is the one providing the jw and admission letter and they won't do so until January 
So can anyone help me in any kind and walk me throu the procedure of applying to visa ( TLS ,embassy ....) Or if am missing any papers 
What is this paper called ""attestation des fonds "" and how do I do it, how long does it take to get an answer for the visa .... 
Any help is appreciated and thank you guys","Two months (January to March) normally should be plenty of time to process it, but make sure you are filling out all parts of all forms completely correctly and don't make any spelling mistakes or accidental inconsistensies, because it may make them deny your visa and force you to start over.

Attestation des fonds is a proof that you have this amount of money in your personal capacity. Its purpose is to ensure that you'll be able to finance yourself while you're there. If the program is funding things like school fees, food and housing, you probably only need proof of that. If you're self-funding it all, probably the way to get this document is have your bank (or your parents' bank, depending on your situation) create it.

Tunisia,budget travel,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Which is better going by ferry or plane? 
And what's the minimum budget I should have considering my friend is hosting me in his home? 
And what are the steps and tips  I should do knowing that it's my first time travelling alone? 

","If you only have a Tunisian passport, you'll need a visa for Italy, and most other countries in the world. It'll cost around 300tnd. Here for more info: [Demander un visa – Ambasciata d'Italia Tunisi (esteri.it)](https://ambtunisi.esteri.it/fr/servizi-consolari-e-visti/servizi-per-il-cittadino-straniero/visti/chiedere-un-visto/)

What do you mean what is better? Like cheaper, faster, more convenient? It's up to the dates you choose, and your own judgement.

Italy isn't very expensive, and since your friend will host you you'll just need some pocket money for public transport and eating out, so around 20€ to 50€ per day.

And as final advice, you could have found the answer to all of your questions very easily if you just used google or took a breath and thought for a few secs, I know it can be overwhelming, but you'll have to think for yourself a lot to plan for this trip, so better start now.

Tunisia,budget travel,Need help deciding which car to buy ?,"aya salem

well i am about to buy a car, my budget is 40-60 k TND and since i am into the SUV type i gotta buy a few years used one even though i prefer to stay away from the used car market in tunisia ( lot of scams ) i am currently choosing from these 3 cars :

\- Nissan qashqai nekta essense model ( year 2016-2017 )

\- renault kadjar

\- VW tiguan

these 3 cars price range between 50 k up to 65 k depending on the car age / distance traveled / condition...

i am open to other car suggesion and for context i am looking for a vehicule that is :

SUV ( preferably ) / economique / for long trips 150-250 km each month for exemple else circulating in the capital for everyday use / i prefer staying out of the chinese car market even though i know there is mixed opinions when it comes to chinese cars among tunisians .","I can understand that preference matters as you want an SUV, however from a POW of a guy who owned 3 cars, nothing can match a 0 km car. 
A used car is full of surprises. 
Buy a 0km and you will have at least 100.000km with just oil changing type of maintenance!
Spare parts are expensive nowadays keep that in mind. 
Edit: after 5 years of owing a car. The 0km will be the kind of première main, 90k km car, 5 years old car on sale. Thats is worth money 
And the used one will be the over 10 years, really old model, almost 200k km car on sales. 


The second point is gas consumption. 
I currently own a 120 horse power car. i am literally enjoying the 'power' and the driving experience it offers. But i miss my previous 75 horse power car consumption. 
As i m paying some 3k dt per year MORE in gas than i used to do. 

Third point, is the gearbox. Real men drive manuel, but i d rather  be called names and drive an automatic 🤣. 

To sum up, i would prefer an automatic 0km i10 over a manuel 70k km Quaskai (tho i m a big fan of quaskai!)

2. **Budgeting:** How much should I budget for a week in terms of food, transportation, and some leisure activities? I'd like to keep my expenses within a reasonable range but also don't want to miss out on great experiences. Any advice on how much money I should bring in Euros would be very helpful.

3. **Must-try Foods and Restaurants:** What are some traditional dishes I should try, and where can I find the best local cuisine in Hammamet?

4. **Mobile plan:** I'll be needing to use my phone and internet connection during my stay, which mobile company plan should I choose and how does it work in Tunis?

Me and my girlfriend are from Bosnia and are looking to visit your country in August and stay for a month - month and a half. We are looking for some tips and experiences from people living there.

We have some basic questions that will determine if we will really visit the place.

First of all, because we come from a poor country, we don't have much money to spend so we would like to know how much would a day of living cost for two people. Not looking for fancy hotels, of course. Couch surfing or hostels are perfectly fine.

Second - if we run short on budget, we have some skills we can use to try and earn some side money. We both know excellent English. My girlfriend does yoga. I can teach programming skills or guitar. I could also play the flute on the street. How welcoming are your people to that kind of thing and how much could we earn per hour?

Third - are your people welcoming towards strangers? We would like to learn and experience your culture as much as possible!

Fourth - how is the weather in August/September?

Fifth - does your country require vaccination proof for entry or is a negative PCR test enough? Do we need to enter quarantine if we aren't vaccinated?

And finally, all in all - what do you recommend the most about your country??

Tunisia,budget travel,"Doctorant en Tunisie, été 2022 // Scholar in Tunisia, Summer 2022"," (english below)

À propos de moi: Je suis un doctorat des États-Unis et je travaille sur ma thèse en histoire de l’environnement qui intègre une étude des chotts tunisiens et algériens. J’ai un mois ou deux l’été prochain après un conférence dans l’Angleterre et je veux passer du temps à vivre et travailler en Tunisie.

Premièrement, il ya a quelques archives régionales (et non régionales) que j’essaye d’accéder à Tunis, Alger et Dakar. Mais d’importance égale, en tant qu’historien de l’environnement, c’est très bénéfique de faire l’expérience dans les lieux que l’on écrit. Je ferai probablement des recherches sur le terrain dans et autour de Gabès, et j’espère voyager dans la région près de Chott el-Djerid. En raison de la pertinence de la Tunisie pour mes études et la relative facilité du processus de visa, j’envisage d’établir ma base en Tunisie pour l’été et prendre l’avion pour Alger et Dakar si j’en ai besoin.

Mes questions:

1. Où est un emplacement idéal pour trouver le logement de courte durée ? J’ai trouvé de nombreux appartements sur l’AirBnB qui sont dans mon budget. J’ai cherché principalement à Tunis parce que les archives sont là, mais y a-t-il d’autres villes que je devrais considérer ? Je cherche des villes pas chers qu’ont un type de transports publics et sont tranquilles.
2. Comment sont les transports publics à travers la Tunisie ? Je vais devoir me rendre à Gabès et autres régions.
3. Je parle français et anglais (et russe, mais ce n’est pas pertinent ici). Je suppose que je peux me débrouiller avec le français ? Je ne parle pas l’arabe tunisien, mais je suis ouvert à apprendre un peu de la langue au préalable.
4. Avez-vous autres conseils ou recommendations ? 

Merci ! 

\-----

About me: I am a PhD candidate from the United States, working on an environmental history dissertation that incorporates a study of the Tunisian and Algerian chotts. I have a month or two next summer following a conference in the UK and I am considering spending that time living and working in Tunisia.

First, there are a couple of regional (and not-so-regional) archives that I am trying to access in Tunis, Algiers, and Dakar. But just as important, as an environmental historian, it is hugely beneficial to experience the places you are writing about. I will likely be conducting some field research in and around Gabès, and hope to travel to some of Chott el-Djerid. Due in part to the relevance of Tunisia to my work, as well as the relative ease of the visa process, I’m thinking of setting up my homebase in Tunisia for the summer and flying to Algiers and Dakar if needed/possible.

So, my questions:

1. Where might be an ideal place to find short-term housing? I’ve found a number of places on AirBnB that are within my budget. I’ve looked mostly in Tunis, as that’s where the archives are, but are there any other cities I should consider? Looking for places that are reasonably priced, have some type of public transport, and are relatively laidback.
2. How is public transportation across the country? I’ll most likely reside in Tunis but will certainly need to travel to Gabès and a couple of other areas. 
3. I speak French and English (and Russian, but that’s not relevant here). I am assuming I will be able to get by with French? I don’t know a word of Tunisian Arabic, but am open to learning a little bit before arriving.
4. Any other advice or recommendations?","1. El Marsa, 20 away from Tunis Downtown.
More expensive but i totally recommend if you want to live a nice Mediterranean experience away from noisy and sometimes chaotic downtown. Most of the trendy places (good reataurants,bars,clubs,cultural activities…) are there and you have marvelous sites such as Carthage and Sidi Bou Said in the area. 
I recommend you to always use taxis for your trips (they should be affordable for you) or TGM( a tram dedicated for the north suburb of Tunis).

2. Public transports are bad. You won’t have difficulties with taxis. To go to Gabes there is a train or flights Tunis-sfax or Tunis Djerba. It’s going to be hard to book a flight ticket anytime you want during the peak season of summer so plan in advance.
You can do it by train too but the conditions and the organization are going to be archaic i guess, i don’t have much informations about it maybe other redditors can provide better informations.

3. You won’t have any problems with French/English. People here are used to speak several languages. 

4..You can still chose other cities like sousse,monastir,hammamet they are all very ok.
But if you want to avoid (mass) touristic areas and live an authentic modern Tunisian experience, the north suburb of Tunis is the place to go for.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/nuso7t/doctorant_en_tunisie_été_2022_scholar_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,fr

Tunisia,cheap hotels,Does Tunisia want high spending tourists?,"I am following r/tunisia and from time to time there are post and comments about cheap tourists (spending only <300€ per stay etc.). Does Tunisia really want to have high spending tourists?

For example:  
2 people, 1 week, 5 Star hotel, flights included from Munich/Germany

1100€ Tunisia --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187)

1300€ Turkey --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209)

Price difference is 200€.

I have good friends from Tunisia that I visited 4 times over the last years. I stayed at their place (Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia) not a hotel (I like it much more, you get to know the people/country). My friends have some contacts so sometimes we went to hotel beaches. The waiters were not very motivated and we had to wait a lot for drinks/food/service etc.  
The same at some restaurants (not all of course), even pricy ones like this in sousse (https://maps.app.goo.gl/SW5SoChbQ26W72788). Sometimes you sit at your table and have to wait for 10-20min until somebody comes, takes orders etc. If you dont give them signals the maybe never come idk. As a tourist I want to spend money but the seemed like the dont want to make buisness.

So why should a (high spending) german tourist come to Tunisia and not Turkey (great service, modern hotels)? Most tourists rather spend 200€ more and go to Turkey for example.

Tunisia has great food, culture, medias etc. but I dont really see the goal to attract high spending tourists.

PS: I really like the country and will come back this year to visit.



","Actually I think Tunisia should manage how tourists spend their money. Hotels are just a blackhole: they do not pay that much taxes, they do not pay their employees that well, they get benefits on water, electricity and subsidiary goods like flour, sugar, goods...

I think Tunisia should rather invest in transportation so that tourists could easily move in the country and actively contribute to the economy by interacting directly with the locals and not by staying in all inclusive hotel for two weeks.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1asbqn2/does_tunisia_want_high_spending_tourists/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia",General,en

Tunisia,cheap hotels,How much should 50min taxi transfer from airport cost roughly?,Got my holiday booked for a couple of weeks time but the coach transfer was super expensive so I skipped it. Thought I would just get a taxi instead as taxis were very cheap last year when I was there. I’m flying in to Enfidha. Looks like the taxi ride would be about 50mins to the hotel. Does anyone know roughly how much this should cost please?,"I've just come back from a holiday in Tunisia, use the Bolt app for taxi, it might be more expensive fares for a local person but with you being a tourist all the taxi drivers are going to try and rip you off, with Bolt the price is fixed at time of booking, so no haggling.

Where are you staying? I remember looking at the fare price from my resort (PEK, Sousse) and it was around 35TND from that airport.

I also tended to tip quite well becuase honestly I couldn't be bothered having the Tunisian coins! So if the ride was like 4.5 I'd just give them 10 TND and say keep the rest.

Even at the inflated Bolt price plus tip it was sooooo much cheaper than what I paid at home I didn't care. My trip from PEK to Sousse was around 11 TND, here in the UK driving that far for a taxi would be 90-100 TND",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/14ko0my/how_much_should_50min_taxi_transfer_from_airport/,Unknown,Inquiry,en

Tunisia,cheap hotels,Project Idea: If there was a Mall in Mahdia,"*These are some wild thoughts which I wanted to preserve here. In case some business man had this idea in mind in the future and found this while they're doing their research.*

Every single resident here in Mahdia Governorate probably agrees with me when I say that life here is boring as hell despite the great potential that it has. Also they would agree more that life is more dull the closer you get to the west of the governorate (my respect to the people in the west of Mahdia ama dawla nset li houma mawjoudin aslan).

So, what could be better than making a Mall in the center of Wileyat Mahdia? To be more precise, that would be by the highway near El Djem.

&#x200B;

>***""How is it gonna be a good investment? And why eljem exactly?""***

I'm glad you asked. First and foremost, El Djem is one of the 2 highway exits in The Governorate of Mahdia. With the second one being Karkar, another town in Mahdia. El Djem would be an advantage because it is a never-miss for tourists meaning that tourists going there would probably stop at the mall to go shopping or have fun. So you have a base source of income. Also, you could add families on road trips and people from Mahdia Gov who want to explore this new mall that is closer than Mall of Sousse.

Second, the land is cheap there. It's technically deserted. So there's little to no demand on lands there meaning the costs of purchasing land for the mall would be less than doing it in the city of Mahdia.

Third, this could be a good source of labor here. *If you don't believe in business ethics and you're a cheap jerk.* You could hire females for half the avg salary. Everyone is doing it here and no one did a thing to stop this.

&#x200B;

There's no rose without thorns however, and this idea has some inconveniences that need to be viewed.

First, the public means of transport would be your biggest money-cutter. You would lose a segment of people who are potential customers but they don't own a car because public transport in Mahdia is dogsh\*t. So you need to manage this problem either with a collab with the state for taxis or sth.

Second, Mahdians in general are resistant to change, especially new things. Locals raided a depot here and forced it to be shut down just cuz they're storing liquor (to be sold to hotels/bars). So you need to either to convince everyone that you're a good person, or be mafiosi so no one f\*cks with you.

Third, you're gonna probably find winter hard to survive as a mall. Half of the young people you're targeting would either study or work in another place. So you either need a huge marketing campaign for the mall's opening (duh) to survive and get the mall to be alive on weekends at least. Or in case you're reading this post in 2030 and somehow New Universities opened nearby then you needn't to worry.

&#x200B;

Anyway, these were my loud thoughts. I hope you liked them. If you have other opinions about this idea share them in this post so our future investor would be more aware of the situation.

Having visited all 24 governorates, every governorate capital and most settlements of note, the cheapest places to stay tend to be shared rooms in either youth hostels or dorms by bus stations or in semi-abandoned old buildings in medinas. I have seen beds for as cheap at 5DT per night (and trust me, in many cases this was still too expensive!)  


So if we are conservative and assume 5DT per hour of drive time and 10DT per night accommodation, with two nights in each of the 24 governorate capitals:  


(5\*30)+(10\*48)= 630 Dinars, not including food, entertainment, or the therapy you will require after such a harrowing low-budget tour of the country.

My all inclusive dinner has been pretty shitty, so my girlfriend and I have eaten in the Hard Rock Cafe for 3 nights (it’s cheap as hell in comparison to back home and good food). The cash machine in my hotel is sketchy and we’ve still not had any cash. If I came in tomorrow with a wedge of money, would it be strange? Would they split it evenly?

Sorry if this sounds really stupid lol","Even though it's expected to tip at night clubs, lounges,bars,etc, waiters would prolly think you're a cheapskate and wouldn't be so inclined to give you excellent service if you keep coming back. I used to work at a night club before (busboy, waiter, and bartender) and l can't tell you how happy tips made us, even though cool/nice customers make most of us almost as happy. As a busboy/busser/barback your assigned waiter is supposed to share his tips with you. As a bartender, waiters are also supposed to give you some of their tips as well.

As a customer, you should always pay an even amount and never wait for your change ( 82 TND tab? Give 90... 89 TND? Give 95 if your waiter was average) There's no real ""set tip percentage"" so you should follow this rule for average service.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,"Why has Tunisia, with its 3000+ years of civilization, fallen behind, while countries like Germany have risen from their setbacks?","I’ve been thinking a lot about this, and it’s really frustrating. Tunisia has an incredible 3000-year history. With such a deep legacy, you’d expect us to be thriving by now. But instead, it feels like we’re stuck in a never-ending struggle.

Take Germany, for example—not to make a direct comparison, but to make a point. After World War I, Germany was in ruins. The country faced severe humiliation and economic collapse. Then came World War II, and Germany was split apart, with cities in devastation. But despite all this, Germany managed to rebuild itself with remarkable resilience. The people were determined to create a better future, prioritizing the common good over personal interests. Their strong sense of patriotism and drive to recover helped them become one of the top economies in the world. Even Hitler's extreme nationalism, while destructive, was driven by a desire to uplift his country.

In contrast, Tunisia’s troubles arguably began when the Beys handed the country over to the French. This decision set a pattern of putting foreign interests before our own. Our leaders have often focused on their personal gain rather than building a strong nation. We exported our best resources, like high-quality wheat, while consuming inferior products ourselves. Where was the drive to build a better Tunisia?

We should have used our 3000 years of history to build a thriving country. Instead, it feels like we lack confidence and ambition. When I talk about improving Tunisia, people often laugh it off, as if dreaming of a better future is unrealistic. This attitude suggests a deep-seated belief that we’re meant to be less, which is really disheartening.

If we truly value our rich heritage, why do we settle for so little? Why aren’t we working towards making Tunisia a better place, with a strong economy, high quality of life, and pride in our achievements? It seems like the real issue is our collective mindset—many people, young and old, don’t believe that meaningful change is possible or worth pursuing.

3000+ years of civilization = 3000+ years of life experience and we still suck

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Shameful news from Tunisia,"In the night of 17 to 18 October 2023, hundreds of young tunisians holding palestinian flags stormed, burned, and destroyed a synagogue and a historical tomb of a rabbi in El Hamma (Gabes governorate) in protest of the ongoing events in the middle east.

According to witness reports on social media, there was no intervention from the local authorities to prevent or stop the destruction of the jewish religious site.

No major media outlet reported the incident yet, and there is no official statement from the tunisian government.

","I think whoever is in power in Tunisia should prioritize reducing tariffs to make it more affordable to import goods. Lowering these taxes would not only enrich our domestic markets but also strengthen Tunisia’s position as a trading hub between Africa and Europe. We should build, or even revive, a major port like the ancient port of Carthage to support this vision. Our strategic location, overseeing both the western and eastern Mediterranean and in close proximity to Europe, is a unique asset that few countries share. By easing tariffs, fostering strong trade partnerships, and investing in infrastructure, Tunisia could play a crucial role in global trade, attracting business and boosting economic stability. With a history rooted in Carthaginian trade, Tunisia has the potential to become a leading Mediterranean gateway for commerce.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,What did the Ottomans leave us ?,"I am doing a little research on our history out of curiosity. Trying to understand the current state of Tunisia and what led to its state.

Taking a look, a very abstract image was concluded from how each country in North Africa, the Middle east and the Balkans, all part of the Ottoman empire back in the days.

Turkey is standing on its feet, 5th strongest country in Turkey as Erdogan calls it. Istanbul is full of fancy mosques, built by gold or whatever, tombs made of gold for the Sultans and their wives, mistresses and sons..It has its own share of problems too, but we can't argue that it's miles ahead of every single land it once occupied when it was an empire.

That reminds of me of France, with its fancy capital, Paris, built when France was importing most of its funds, labors and money from African countries they conquered.

Going through the internet, and in Syrian and Egyptians threads and asking, and also watching the famous Youtuber 'Dahih', the Mamaliks episodes.. Egypt's weakening as a strong nation started from the end of the Mamaliks, by the hands of Selim 1, the famous greedy Ottoman ruler.

""Ottomans entering Egypt was Similar to Mongols entering Baghdad"" -- quoted from a historian 'Dahih' mentioned in the video.

.. it's not about military, but about the foundation, infrastructure, etc... All Ottomans did was build barracks and fortresses and walls, no hospitals, no dams, no schools... same was stated by a few Syrians I talked with in Reddit. And they are the closest neighbors to Turkey. 

From the looks of it, it was the basic empire ruling : ""Make them pay taxes, strengthen our military, recruit more troops ' the famous Janissaries system ' and expand more our empire"" As they clearly didn't get two shits about Islam, so why they engaged with Egypt and Safavids, who were already muslim kingdoms ? I think of course there are other factors, but I do believe the first one was simply greed. And one of the roots of the current splits within the Arab world could be because of he way Ottoman sultans ruled and not deciding to form genuine alliances with Arabs and North Africans.

Let's look away from the middle east and North Africa and take a look at the Balkans.. they are slightly better, but far worse than western Europe. Now first, again, I'm not blaming everything on the Ottoman empire but I'm looking and searching.. Balkans are in a mess because of the Yugoslavian war, but things aren't looking good, and again, checking out their foundation as nations, it's not that promising. Ottoman empire has a very bad reputation there too, even in Busnia ( again from the very few stuff I checked on the internet ).

Now my question is, I might be missing something, but first of all fuck the French colonists, but they did build hospitals, bridges ( I'm from Bizerte and the moving bridge, the school I studied in, the hospital where I was born, were all built by French ).. but did the Ottomans leave us anything similar, like anything infrastructure related or something ? Hence, we have might have more heritage from the Caliphate time than the Ottomans...

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,"What I know of Tunisia is that it is the Arab's Spring success story. Is this true? If so, why is its role so underrated in the Arab Spring's history?","Hi. Press about Tunisia has been sporadic in the West at best about Tunisia, so about three years ago I went there on vacation for 2 weeks. I decided to drive around and couchsurf. The people I met and the places I visited made my time there an absolute wonder.

I liked to talk about how the country was doing, and met with a few guys from a local atheist group. A British historian who had been there for 40odd years. A 25 year old Tunisian girl who I fell in love with, and made out with secretly, safe distance away from the woman's hostel where she lived. I spoke with liberal elite intellectuals in Tunis, and even with the then campaign manager from Nidaa Tounes, because there were elections coming up. That was all in fluent English.

I loved it then, but only now realize my limited slice of Tunisia I saw. With many locals I only had small conversations in my very limited French. No deep discussions. 

Still, in 2014 Tunisia felt to me as a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany. (I was there then as a visitor but I was only 10. So what did I know...) I haven't been to Tunisia since then, and news is sparse. 

I noticed how Wikipedia's Arab Spring page doesn't place Tunisia front and center of the Arab Spring. The lead-up to the Arab Spring omits Bouazizi's story. The 'results' doesn't speak about Tunisia's successes. I find all that lack of attention so incredibly odd. Are we missing a success story, or is there nothing to celebrate? 

And that's why I came here:

How is Tunisia doing?
And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?
Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?
Where is Tunisia going to?

TL;DR: Anyone providing any insight into the questions above would be great.

PS As a thank you to the country and its role in the Arab Spring, I went to Mohamed Bouazizi's grave and took a picture of his grave for Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi ","
>How is Tunisia doing?

From which side? 

i'm gonna presume you mean overall 
Well economicly the government made new austerity measures in order to reduce the budget deficiency to less than 5%, well that was good on paper until the new measuers took place since it fueled many protests across the country under the slogan ‘فاش نستنو‘ 'what are we waiting for', people are talking about a sencond Uprising especially since tomorrow happens  to be the 8th revolution memory 

>And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?

As it is mentioned  above there is no big interest in our country since we're a small one with limited natural resources 

>Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?

short answer : no

Long answer : Bouazizi was not a war hero, he was some random guy who felt the oppression and decided enough is enough and sat himself on fire, during ben ali regime the question was not who is gonna start the uprising, it's when 

>Where is Tunisia going to?

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,"Gambling, Not Investing: The Reality of Trading Crypto","Hey everyone,

Lately, I’ve been noticing a growing number of people wanting to get into trading, especially in cryptocurrencies. On top of that, more and more online trading courses are popping up, promising to teach you how to **""live off trading.""**

Let me introduce myself: **I'm Selim,** finance student in Canada, currently finishing my diploma and starting my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) certification. One of my dreams is to create a portfolio management fund, so I know a thing or two about this topic (though I’m not claiming to be a genius).

I’ve been interested in cryptocurrencies for over 5 years and have seen just about everything—bull runs, bear markets, copy-trading, and even **people faking demo portfolios on platforms like CoinMarketCap to fool others**. Honestly, it makes me laugh to see how far some will go to take advantage of people’s lack of knowledge, and the worst part? **People actually believe them.**

Today, I’m here to explain **why 99.9% of the people who claim to be profitable in crypto, or even make enough money to live from trading, are lying or, at best, exceptions to the rule.** I also want to break down why, for most people, **crypto-trading isn’t much different from gambling.**

**What is trading? A quick history lesson**

Before diving deeper, let’s take a moment to understand what trading really is.

Trading dates back centuries, and one of the earliest examples involves **merchant ships and shared investments**. At the time, trading wasn’t about buying and selling stocks or currencies—it was a practical way to share risk.

Here’s how it worked:

* A group of investors would put their money  together to buy a ship.
* The ship would embark on a journey, often lasting months, to sell goods in distant markets.
* When the ship returned, the investors would sell the remaining goods and even the ship itself, splitting the profits.

This is the foundation of trading: **taking calculated risks with the hope of earning returns.** But back then, trading was based on tangible goods and real economic activity—not speculative price movements.

Today, however, most “trading” has little to do with creating value or sharing risks. In crypto markets, it’s often closer to gambling, as I’ll explain below.

# 1. Trading is closer to gambling than investing

First off, let’s make one thing clear: **trading is not investing.** When you trade, you’re not creating any value. You’re simply betting on price fluctuations. These fluctuations often **follow a random pattern**—what mathematicians call a **Brownian motion**.

Here’s the problem:

* Imagine flipping a coin. You have a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing.
* With trading fees, your odds are even worse—your chances of winning drop below 50%.

In other words, **over time, the average trader will lose money** because the odds are stacked against them.

# 2. The odds of consistent profits are stacked against you

Trading is a **zero-sum game**: for every winner, there’s an equivalent loser. And when you add fees from platforms like Binance or Coinbase, it becomes a **negative-sum game.**

Here’s a simple equation:

>**E\[R\]=G−F**

E\[R\] = expected return  
G = gross gain potential  
F = fees and costs

Even if you’re good at trading, fees chip away at your profits. Over time, **your average return becomes negative.**

# 3. Randomness drives most “success stories”

A lot of people who claim they’re making big money in crypto trading are either lying or mistaking luck for skill.

* **The law of large numbers**: If 10,000 people trade crypto, it’s inevitable that a handful will make huge gains purely by chance. These people then brag about their “success,” but they’re the exception, not the rule.
* **Survivorship bias**: You only hear about the winners, not the thousands of people who’ve lost their shirts.

# 4. It’s not as simple as a few charts and some gut feelings

***I’ve even seen someone open a trading training center, claiming to teach others how to “succeed” in crypto***. But let me be honest: **as someone studying finance, trading successfully is far from simple.**

To truly become a professional trader, you need:

* A deep understanding of **mathematics**,
* Knowledge of **predictive models**,
* Expertise in **quantitative finance** (and that’s just the beginning).

You’re not just up against other individual traders. You’re competing with:

* **High-frequency trading algorithms,**
* **Quant teams at banks and hedge funds,**
* **Institutions with access to data and technology you can’t even dream of.**

Believing you can beat them by looking at a couple of charts and making a few guesses is, quite frankly, naïve. **Yes, it’s possible to make money occasionally**, especially if you’re well-informed on a few specific cryptos. But let’s be real: it’s no different from hitting a lucky streak at the casino.

# 5. Our lack of financial education is part of the problem

**I’m not here to hate on anyone or crush anyone’s dreams**. I just want to open people’s eyes. It’s sad to see so many people get caught up in false promises and waste their money because of **a lack of financial education.**

If our countries placed more emphasis on teaching financial literacy, people wouldn’t fall for these scams or illusions of easy money. They’d understand that **real wealth is built through reasonable, long-term investments not gambling on short-term price swings.**

# Final thoughts

I understand the excitement around crypto—it’s a fascinating space. But if you’re serious about building wealth, focus on:

* Diversifying your portfolio,
* Investing regularly (for exemple every month you can save 20% of your salary to invest it)
* And avoiding the traps of short-term speculation.

And please, ask yourself this:  
**If these so-called trading “experts” were really making so much money, why are they wasting their time selling you courses for 200dt?**

Take care of your money, and remember: financial freedom isn’t built overnight, and it’s certainly not built on luck.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Should We Merge with the rest of the Maghrebi states ?,"The north african (maghrebi) states have always been and will continue to be non sovereign and heavily influenced by external powers: Tunisia for example, a small resource poor state with a small work force and a small economic market has been an economic and political shithole for so long and will continue to be for a long indefinite time. Speaking socially, the different identities built on the centralized states’ unnatural borders are non-factual: the people in southeast Tunisia (Zarzis, Tataouine, medenine..) for a example have a lot more in common in terms of traditions or dialect or landscape with the rest of theTripolitanian region (northwest libya) than they do with the rest of Tunisia the same goes for the southwest in relation with the adjacent Algerian region of Toughourt (el wed, biskra..) or the northwest with the Algerian east (Tebessa, Elgalla, Annaba..) and this patern can be observed all over the region (the Maghrebi dialect continuum). Almost all studies have proven that the Maghrebi non-unification has already costed billions of dollars of lost potential economic grown, the region has since the fall of the almohads had no major role in history only being dominated and colonized by super powers which made sure to induce as many conflicts in the region as they could so no unified block could stand in the way (Western Sahara, Morrocan-Algerian border conflicts..). If the region is to remain divided, we will have no role in history, all facts point that way. these divided states in the grand scale of history will be insignificant, never properly prosper, never have a sovereign foreign policy and never compete in a space race (bear with me).
History has proven that every nation wishing to prosper has to expand and i see no future for the region unless a federal state like that of the US or Germany is formed.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Tunisia should not be inspired by Arabs,"Tunisia should not be socially, culturally or politically inspired by Arabs.

Every Arab country is a failure, except the ones with oil.

* Fear of minorities which turns into hatred.
* Refusal of making compromises. When they are strong, arabs say « I am strong. Why should I compromise ? » and when they are weak, arabs say « I am weak, how can I compromise ?! »
* Dialoguec can be seen as a sign of weakness. 
* Intense emotions at the expense of pragmatism
* Obsession about honor
* Toxic Masculinity. Sorry but it's true. Men must inherit twice as much as Women. If a family has a daughter, the money must go to her uncle. In Saudi Arabia, a female school burned down with girls inside instead of letting them leave, because they had no veil. In Egypt, a woman was sent to prison for criticizing harassment.
* Deep insecurity over humiliation.  It’s very hard in Arab culture to admit a mistake. Mistakes are associated with humiliation. It’s exceptional to hear  Arabs say *« We made a bad mistake. We apologize and will try to fix it »*
* Difficulty to think in nuances. (« They are partially right»). Thoughts are only expressed in extremes (« They are right » « They are wrong »). 
* Blind obedience to authorities figures. Fear of contradicting them. (« Professor,  I disagree with this idea »).

Every human is flawed but these characteristics are all arab cultural traits.

That is not to say Arab culture don't have qualities like Generosity toward strangers or courage on the battlefield. But I think in the case of Tunisia, the flaws outweight the benefits.",">Every Arab country is a failure, except the ones with oil.

All Arab countries have oil, natural gas, gold or some other precious resource. It's just that some are able to build a successful industry while others do not.

>Refusal of compromise.

No they're not. Like not even a little bit. You just said a bunch of randome things and then attributed to them to the Arabs.

I'll say this to you and every self-hating Arab out there: **being Arabs has never been a handicap**. The issues facing Tunisia today have nothing to do with our Arab culture or heritage. Disconnecting from Arab culture will not fix **any** of Tunisia's problems.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,"From This moment, I will be an Anti Ultras Man.","Before getting directly through the topic, Let me tell you that I support Club Africain since I was a little kid.

To be frank, it wasn't my father who sparked my passion for the club. It all began when I watched one of the iconic capital derbies between CA and EST live. The excitement, the intensity, and the fierce desire to win all came together, drawing me to one side of this legendary rivalry. The golden version of Club Africain (2007-2011) will never repeat itself in history, because you will never find players like Lassad Elouarteni, Oussama Sallami, Youssef Mouihbi, Alexis Enam Mendomo, Zouheir Eldhouadi and the golden boy Wissem yahia. Also, you may've known about the legendary miraculous 2008's expedition to win the league title under the leadership of the Algerian coach AbdelHakk ben Shikha, and the famous last match against ES Zarzis.

Anyway, I'm not here to explain why I love this club. I came to address a serious and a dangerous ideology. I apologize for the unrelated paragraph, but I felt it was important to show that I'm a passionate fan, not just someone passing by.

The Ultras is a world wide movement, almost every football club around the world has a group of fans who distinguish themselves as Ultras (Ultras fanatics). In stadiums, those groups had dedicated seats in either the north side or the south side of the stands behind the goals. They usually have a leader who they call ""CAPO"", the role of the Capo is crucial in leading the chanting and energizing the crowd inside the stadium. A team can have more than 1 ultras group. For example, Club Africain has several Ultras groups, but specifically has 4 active groups: (Dodger's 2007, African Winners 1995, Leaders Clubistes 2003 And North Vandals 2007). they all form the well-known Curva Nord which means ""The north stands"" ""المدارج الشمالية"". At the start of each home match, Ultras groups are famous in organizing and creating ""TIFOS"" that display how great the club is in terms of popularity, honor and achievements (not just athletic achievements, they can be social and political achievements). they can also display dishonor to the rival club and clash other clubs.

All of this is amazing and wonderful, those things reflect the beauty of Football matches and their charm.

But:

# Why I hate Ultras, especially Tunisian Ultras?

Most ultras consider themselves anti-establishment or anti-system, which I personally see as problematic. They view the police, who are there to ensure the security of the stadium, as enemies or adversaries. Ultras often harbor the unrealistic dream of having stadiums free of police presence, which is impractical in today's world.

In protests, stadiums, public events, commercial centers, every huge gathering requires crowd control to prevent chaos and panic. because when panic appears in a crowd, nobody is safe. To be frank, Omar abidi's death was a consequence of the mutual irresponsibility of the Curva Nord and the police. Surely, the Police back then have abused their power, but we can't overlook the chaos that was made by the fans in the ""virage"".

In Tunisia, ultras have been involved in several serious incidents, including street violence, robberies, threats, and verbal abuse of family members. They've also been known to bully teenagers, especially kids wearing rival team jerseys. In one particular incident, a group of ultras forced a father to remove his Club Africain shirt in front of his disabled daughter simply because he was in Bizerte.

We need to learn how to support our teams in a civilized way.

We either need to get rid of this mentality and lean to a more peaceful one. Why I've to be afraid when going to stadiums with my family? Am I going to war?","https://preview.redd.it/9jsguvz8wbrd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6df3e2287f6301f34e3d3d16d9403511a4849eb

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Upon checking his history, I found out that the same thing kept happening whenever he replied and started attacking someone.

Here is my comment:

so he replied:

>Whether you like it or not, whether you assimilate or discriminate against Jews, our 2,000 years in the diaspora is an inseparable part of our identity and culture. A Palestinian has no more right to North African food because it was colonized by Arabs than the descendants of an Israeli culture of which North African Jewry has become an inseparable part of.

-We always talk about christian europeans, coptic egyptians, christian middle easterners, or christian ethiopians. But rarely have i seen someone mentionning the christian history of north africa.

-Where are the christian remains in North Africa, the only churches I have seen are the ones made during the French colonisation, wich means in 1850. But are there any from 15th century? 7th?  4th?

-Also a question of habit, we (personnaly) always see a big majority of north african muslims, a chunk of jewish, but never seen a christian tunisian in Tunisia. Thats why it has become strange, for me at least, to see a possible christian community in north africa.

-Kind of the same reason, but I cant really picture my tunisian friends, family. For example I couldn't picture my grandma Aicha, as a christian, like praying in churches, etc... Because its a habit, im usually confronted to muslim and jewish north africans but never christians.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,"American Tunisian, what is modern Tunisia like?","I am an American & lived in the US all my life. I have some Tunisian ancestry (and citizenship). I have little ties with the culture & I can't speak Arabic. Although my father spent a lot of his upbringing in Tunisia + speaks fluent arabic/french, my mother does not so I grew up fairly Americanized.

I took trips to Tunisia every few years throughout my childhood, but I have not been there in over a decade. There were some things I loved about visiting, family life there always felt so warm and vibrant (could just be biased with my particular extended family), toughness of the people, the mediterranean & desert, the ancient history, some of the traditional music. (I know, probably rose-tinted tourist glasses).

However there were some things that made me uncomfortable:  
  
- The first is the sense that it was an overly religious country. Im not religious at all and felt I must kind of lie & ""play along"" to prevent any conflict. I remember being yelled at by a cousin for touching a Quran without washing my hands as a kid, which baffled me at the time. I think its easier to see the beauty in religion when its not forced upon me. This coupled with some anti-american sentiment I witnessed in public made me feel unwelcome, even though people were always nice.   
  
- Brain/Success drain, a lot of my dual citizen or successful cousins left Tunisia for better opportunities, I always wondered how much this hurts development and prosperity of the country.  
  
- Nagged: In certain contexts I come off as a tourist so the extreme salesmanship from vendors was  annoying (but its just the way it goes I know people are hustling to get by).

**Have things changed at all?**

- Are people more or less secular?  
- What is the sentiment towards tourists? Americans specifically?  
- What are the more common desires and aspirations of young adults, do most professionals want to leave or stay in the country?  
- Are there a lot more english speakers given how online we all are now?  
- How safe is the country? (I know this upsets people, because here in the US we likely have a lot more senseless violence)

That is weird salafist behavior - especially between family members, your (extended) family might be a bit more religious than average.

  
> Brain/Success drain, a lot of my dual citizen or successful cousins left Tunisia for better opportunities, I always wondered how much this hurts development and prosperity of the country.

Not wrong.

  
> Nagged: In certain contexts I come off as a tourist so the extreme salesmanship from vendors was annoying (but its just the way it goes I know people are hustling to get by).

  
Every tourist-economy suffers from this, including other countries like Italy.

  
Now to your questions:

> Are people more or less secular?

Too many variables. Depends on the region/family. The harder the times, the more religious people are.

Tunisia is backsliding since the 2011 revolution in terms of liberal values and secularism.

> What is the sentiment towards tourists? Americans specifically?

No one will dislike you for being an American tourist. Views towards America/American foreign policy don't have to do with American people visiting the country. Nonetheless, you're Tunisian, not an American tourist. You don't need to fit in to be Tunisian.

> What are the more common desires and aspirations of young adults, do most professionals want to leave or stay in the country?

The majority want to leave if given the chance,. I don't blame them after 10 years of stagnation.

> Are there a lot more english speakers given how online we all are now?

Younger people tend to speak more English, but you can't really do much in terms of public administration / day to day life without French or Arabic.

> How safe is the country? (I know this upsets people, because here in the US we likely have a lot more senseless violence)

Other than petty crimes and other stuff you would expect in any country, generally safe. But common sense please the same way you'd behave in the US, don't expect a proactive police force or an extreme sense of safety that you'd find in the UAE/Qatar etc.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,I need an advice,"Hi everyone, my name is Khaled, and I'm 18 years old. I’ve been interested in history since I was a kid, and around 13 , I started focusing more on this subject. By mid 16, my interest shifted to politics, and I began to focus specifically on Tunisian politics. I’ve noticed that Tunisia seems to be slowly moving towards a dictatorship, which deeply concerns me. I care a lot about the future of my country and don’t want to see it falling apart, especially after the revolution. I want to help my friends, especially other teenagers, become more aware of our political situation, though I don’t blame them for minding their own business. Sometimes I wonder if I’m too young for this and if it’s normal to be so focused on these issues while other teenagers are just enjoying their youth. I’m thinking about starting a club at my high school to raise awareness and encourage more people to care about our country’s future, but I’m worried about the risks, including the possibility of getting into trouble or facing arrest, especially with the current situation in Tunisia. This year is crucial for me because it’s my baccalaureate year, and I don’t want to mess it up with risky decisions. I had been hesitant to ask this question on Reddit because I feared being judged for my age, but seeing a post from someone wanting to start a political party inspired me to seek advice.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Did Prophet Muhammed Peace Be Upon Him oppressively killed the Jews or It was an act of justice?,"P.S: This is a very long post; so bear with the post and I hope you get a nice reading.

The lack of knowledge about Islamic history in Tunisia, along with our patrimonial ignorance, is deeply terrifying (not in a good way). 

Anyway, I hold no hatred towards atheists or those who choose not to identify as Muslims, I think it’s their personal choice and belief. I fully support their right to express their beliefs and views freely. The problem here is that some part of their side of the discussion sometimes overexaggerates in criminalizing prophet Muhammed, labeling him as a sexist, a pedophile, a blood-thristy warlord and a Jews hater (the “antisemitism” term didn’t exist at the time :p).But as a muslim, and in my honest opinion, I think that most of their claims are false. I don’t have the time to defend from the accusations of each claim. Yet, I will specifically focus on a topic that has proved the ignorance imposed by the education’s system in Tunisia.

The topic is about whether Prophet Muhammed killed the Jews in an oppressive way or it was an act of establishing justice. Many have attempted to portray the Jewish people at the time of Prophet Muhammad as victims of the ""bloodthirst"" of a pro-claimed peaceful religion, without going into the historical facts or fully understanding the reasons behind those events. I can’t deny this fact of killing but it was all under some circumstances of a specific context.

Before discussing directly the topic, let’s first understand several things:

* Who’re the Jews of Yathrib?
* How Prophet Muhammed established the nation of Islam?

# Who’re the Jews of Yathrib?

Before the coming of Islam, Jews lived in Yathrib (later known as Medina) and were divided into three well-known tribes: Banu Qurayza, Banu Qaynuqa, and Banu Nadir. They were somewhat separated from the Arab pagan tribes, residing in different locations. Each Jewish tribe lived in a well-defended fortress, capable of withstanding a siege for some time due to their ample supplies of food and water (a point that may seem minor now but will be relevant later). These tribes controlled Yathrib's economy through their practice of charging interest, establishing themselves as the dominant economic force in the region.

Additionally, most biographical records of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) provide evidence of Jewish conspiracies against the pagan tribes. These records notify that the Jews played a significant role in manipulating the infamous conflict between the Aws and Khazraj tribes. Actually, they were strategically financing & supplying the 2 tribes in order to keep the fighting on. Specifically, Aws was allied with Banu Qurayza and the Khazraj was backed by Banu Nadir.

The 2 tribes kept exhausting each other for around 60-120 years and this facilitated Jewish control over Medina.

# How Prophet Muhammed established the nation of Islam?

One of the main reasons that pushed Prophet Muhammed’s migration (Hijrah) was in order to make a peace pact between the 2 tribes (Aws and Khazraj). So, his mission was to fix what already had been corrupted by the Jews. After he did that, he went ahead with establishing a brotherhood between the Emigrants (Almuhajereen) and The residents of Yathrib who supported his message (AlAnsar).

Then he enacted the Umma Document or the constitution of Medina (Saheefat alMadinah) which was a document that organized the tribal affairs of Medina and was the formal declaration of the establishment of a multi-religious state under Islamic Jurisprudence. Jews weren’t excluded from the pact and all 3 Jewish tribes were involved in the acts of the Document (you can check in this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina)).

**The pact clarifies the duties of each tribe towards defending Medinah.** 

Jews accepted their new place as being part of the new founded nation.

Now let’s see what really happened afterwards:

1. **Jews expected the appearance of a prophet, but they were disappointed because prophet Muhammed emerged from the pagan tribes of Mekkah rather from amongst them:** When news of the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) appearance reached the Jews, many were envious and, like Quraysh, feared losing their influence. They were uncertain whether to relinquish power or oppose him. Each tribe had different perspectives on how to deal with it. In the end, all chose to form an alliance with him, but at the same time, a large part of them secretly worked against him behind the scenes.

When the Prophet arrived in Medina, a group of Jews sought to investigate him through a series of questions in a debate-like manner. Their aim was to verify the signs mentioned in the Torah. They asked him about the stories of Prophet Moses, the children of Israel, and events related to the afterlife. Additionally, they wanted to see if he bore the ""Seal of Prophethood.""

The Seal of Prophethood (*Khatam an-Nubuwwah*) also refers to a physical mark on the body of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), a distinguishing sign found on the backs of most prophets.

Abdullah ibn Salam was a Jewish scholar who converted to Islam and is known for his critical views on the behavior of some of his fellow Jews during his time. According to Islamic tradition, he became a Muslim after witnessing the honesty and integrity of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which contrasted sharply with the dishonesty he observed among some Jewish leaders and scholars.

In Islamic sources, Abdullah ibn Salam's conversion is often cited as an example of how the truthfulness and moral character of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) were compelling enough to lead people from different backgrounds to embrace Islam. His observations about the dishonesty of certain individuals in his community are used to highlight the contrast between genuine faith and hypocrisy.

**2. The Exile of Banu Nadir:**

This event was the turning point of the plot. 

After the **Battle of Uhud**, tensions between the Muslims and the Banu Nadir began to rise. The specific incident that led to the assassination plot involved the **death of two men** from a neighboring tribe who were killed by a Muslim. According to the Umma Document (Saheefat alMedina), blood money (compensation) needed to be paid to the tribe. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) went to the Banu Nadir, who were wealthy and expected to contribute to the payment of the blood money, as per the pact.

While the Prophet Muhammad was at their settlement discussing the matter, the Banu Nadir leaders, led by **Huyayy ibn Akhtab**, secretly conspired to assassinate him. They plotted to drop a large stone on the Prophet from the roof of a house where the meeting was being held. This was an attempt to eliminate the Prophet and disrupt the growing power of the Muslim community in Medina.

Before the plot could be executed, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received a divine revelation about the assassination plan. He immediately left the area, avoiding the attack. This betrayal marked a severe breach of the Constitution of Medina, as the Banu Nadir had broken their peace agreement. **\[Act of Treason N° 1\]**

In response to this assassination attempt, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) gave Banu Nadir an ultimatum to leave Medina within ten days. Initially, they agreed to leave, but they were later encouraged by **Abdullah ibn Ubayy**, the leader of the hypocrites (munafiqun) in Medina, to resist and not to comply. They fortified themselves in their strongholds, leading to a siege by the Muslim forces.

The outcomes of the battle aren't necessary to mention, because they don’t serve as arguments for the defense of Prophet Muhammed PBUH.

The important thing to mention is that Banu Nadir have finally relocated to Khaybar and began to conspire with Quraysh and other enemies of Islam to retaliate against the Muslims.

**3. Ahzab Coalition, Battle of Ahzab and the betrayal of Banu Qurayza:**

The exiled Banu Nadir leaders, notably **Huyayy ibn Akhtab**, played a key role in forming an alliance (the ""Ahzab,"" meaning ""confederates"") against the Muslims.

Jews and the pagans of Mekkah swear by holding together the curtains of the Kaaba to form an alliance and to never betray each other; the ones who used to be enemies, they surprisingly became friends just to counter Prophet Muhammed.

Nevertheless, they managed to unite several groups, including the Quraysh, the Ghatafan tribe, and other Bedouin tribes, creating a massive army of around 10,000 men with the aim of crushing the Muslim community and their allies in Medina. 

When the siege of Medina began, Jews of Banu Nadir tried to approach their fellow jews in Bani Qurayza; they urged them not to fear the wrath of prophet Muhammed and join the Ahzab. And they suggested to them to leave the back of Medina uncovered and undefended. Banu Qurayzah agreed to defect.

**4. Threat from within:**

The betrayal of the Banu Qurayzah was a serious blow to the Muslims. They were stationed on the southern side of Medina, where there was no trench or significant defense, and their defection meant that the Muslims were now vulnerable to an attack from within the city of Medina. The Muslims were already outnumbered and dealing with the massive coalition army outside, so the internal threat forced them to split their attention and resources. **\[Act of treason n°2\]**

**5. The siege of Banu Qurayzah:**

After the Ahzab forces withdrew, weakened by the trench, adverse weather conditions, and internal disagreements, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions immediately turned their attention to the Banu Qurayzah for their betrayal. The Muslims laid siege to the fortress of Banu Qurayzah, which lasted for about **25 days.**

**6. Surrender of Banu Qurayzah and the Judgement of Sa’ad ibn Mu’adh:**

Realizing they were isolated and could not hold out indefinitely, the Banu Qurayzah eventually surrendered. They requested that one of the Prophet’s companions, **Sa’d ibn Mu’adh**, a leader of the Aws tribe who had previously been an ally of the Jews, act as an arbitrator. Sa’d had been severely wounded during the earlier siege but agreed to judge the matter.

Sa’d made a judgment based on **Jewish law**, which prescribed severe penalties for treason and betrayal in times of war. His judgment was that:

* The **men** of Banu Qurayzah who had taken part in the treason and betrayal would be **executed**.
* The **women and children** would be **taken as captives**.
* The **property** of the Banu Qurayzah would be divided among the Muslims.

This judgment was carried out, and it had a significant impact on the Muslim community and the remaining Jewish tribes in the region.

To summarize, the Jews were punished according to their own laws, experiencing a taste of their own medicine. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) enforced a judgment that mirrored what they themselves would have imposed on a traitor. By executing the penalty for betrayal, he responded to their treachery in a manner consistent with their own practices. If the Prophet had pardoned them, it could have encouraged other tribes to breach the alliance, rendering the pact of unity in Medina ineffective and worthless.

Remember the Messenger's role in the Medina is to preserve the newly-founded nation of Islam. He’s not just a prophet, he's a nation leader. ",https://preview.redd.it/kky1kirkl8pd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb5c48b996da34be3d201775aea5ab722dbc9f1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fiesqp/did_prophet_muhammed_peace_be_upon_him/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,My thoughts on Canada as someone who has lived there for almost a decade,"There’s a lot of confusion about Canada as it’s becoming super popular right now (because of increased immigration targets), so I figured I’d clear up some confusion as someone who lived in Canada for almost a decade and know different provinces.

There’s a lot of stuff I want to tell people if they ask me for advice about moving to Canada but I refrain from saying everything because they want to hear what they like to hear otherwise they think I somehow have something against them personally.. so this is going to sound blunt but in my opinion it’s the unfiltered truth

# Canada is two countries dressed up as one

Canada has a federal system, meaning that every province in Canada controls a subset of areas, most notably things around rent/healthcare/schooling so things vary wildly between provinces including even taxes. There’s 4 main provinces where most Canadians live: Ontario (38% of population, 38% of GDP/economy), Quebec (22% of population, 20% of GDP), British Columbia (13% of population, 14% of GDP), Alberta (11% of population, 15% of GDP). However, most provinces are similar and create laws that are close to each other to make things smoother. For example, nearly all provinces have 19 as the drinking age, the same maximum interest rate you can charge…etc 

Quebec, however, is so different from the rest it can almost be its own country. It’s the only province allowed to collect its own taxes, run its own retirement program, control its own immigration. It’s also the only majority French speaking province and has very specific laws about this because they care a lot about French. It even has a different approach to housing making housing much cheaper in Quebec than anywhere in Canada (for example rent in Montreal which is one of Canada’s biggest cities is much cheaper than even small cities in Ontario not even Toronto) but Quebec also has higher taxes for the average person (and not much different for high incomers).

Quebec generally has lower economic opporurtinities compared to the other provinces (mostly due to it isolating itself with French) and pays lower salaries on higher average taxes. At the same time, it’s cheaper than the other main provinces in almost all aspects but especially in housing (Alberta being a bit similar there). 

Now onto more controversial things, Quebecois have their own distinct culture and history to the point that Quebec wanted to leave Canada which they almost did a couple of times. If you ever visit Quebec and another province, you'll notice immediately that they feel like different countries from laws to architecture to people's attitudes. While Alberta is the most right wing province, Quebec is by far the most racist and especially when it comes to muslims. It's more similar to France in this aspect (so trying to ban hijab, they even protested a muslim/maghrebi neighborhood…etc) while the rest of Canada, even Alberta, is much more accepting and is closer to the stereotypical image people have of a Canadian. Moreover, most people in the rest of Canada have not even heard of Tunisia (and sometimes Algeria). 

So when people talk about Canada, they should specify what province they’re talking about but much much more importantly Quebec or Rest of Canada, especially that up to 95% of Tunisians live in Quebec the last time I checked stats. Also, I’ll talk mostly about the rest of Canada because while I know Quebec quite well, I have never lived in it for more than 2 months. 

# Why are recent immigrants often unhappy

This is very subjective but based on my own observations. Immigraiton in Canada has shifted significantly, the federal government increased its immigraiton targets insanely (accepting 1m people a year for a country of 40m when it used to be 200-300k/yr). People come to Canada with very high expectations, they hear about healthcare, social and public services, the reputation of a high standard of living…etc and the reality ends up being different but people are shocked to see that because while they hear these stories about Italy/France, they don't know about Canada.

This happens because of many reasons

# Cost of living doesn’t match salaries 

With the surge of immigrants but no increase in housing built, housing costs have soared. You have to pay $3000/mo for a 1bd in Toronto right now. So did demand on a lot of stuff, not to mention the soaring prices across the world. People basically underestimate how much it takes to live in a big city in Canada.

Also, salaries are higher on average in Canada than most of the EU and of course way higher than Tunisia so people accept offers not knowing what kind of standard of living it will get them. Moreover, the kind of super fast immigraiton growth in Canada is not done in proportion with high paying jobs in Canada, so in other words Canada is bringing in immigrants mostly to work jobs that Canadians don’t want or work jobs that Canadians want but not at a salary Canadians would accept. 

Canadian companies also value Canadian experience and degrees and will pay you less or won’t hire you if you don’t have it. This is the case everywhere but especially true for Canada and is a well documented problem. People don’t have this problem nearly as much in the US or also to a lesser degree in the EU. Most people coming here will be underemployed (not unemployed, but working jobs they’re overqualified or underpaid for). This is hard to understand for immigrants coming to Canada because they compare it to countries with lower cost of living, it’s also why I hear that salaries in Canada are not that high compared to France…etc when in reality they are, it’s just that they’re high for people with Canadian degrees and experience. 

# Healthcare

Healthcare is free in Canada but it’s not easily available. You can wait for a year to find a family doctor and going to the ER for an emergency you can wait for 5 hours+. This is despite Canada spending insane amounts on healthcare, much more than Europe but the result is worse. I personally decided to fly to Tunisia next time I need something like a minor surgery.

# Taxes

Taxes are low compared to EU for the average person in Canada but they’re incredibly high for high incomers. It goes up to 55% marginal tax (i.e. what you pay for every extra dollar you earn). Being successful in Canada means you get destroyed by taxes while social services are not at the same level you’d find in high tax countries like Norway or Sweden. 

# Housing

Besides rent which I discussed, buying a house or apartment in most of Canada has become impossible. My salary is in the top 1% but it's not enough to buy the average house in Canada let alone in expensive cities in Canada. This is because housing prices soared in the last 10 years, making a lot of people who own a house much richer and creating a problem with housing affordability including higher rent.

# Would you recommend Canada? 

It depends on a million factors but to me, unless you can move to the US, Canada makes sense compared to EU if and only if you get a well paying job. Compared to staying in Tunisia, there's very few scenarios where I'd recommend not moving.

Canada is probably the best country to be in for someone looking for an average life (even compared to the US), taxes are low and the standard of living is pretty good compared to France/Italy/Spain minus the healthcare issue. 

If you want to move here on a below average salary or if you’re a very high income earner (200k+), Canada is a bad deal. On a below average salary, you’ll struggle with the basic necessities because they’re expensive here (rent, transportation, food). On a high income, you’ll pay insane taxes and won’t get much in return for it.

Finally, I hope this comes across as a balanced overview because trust me I’m not trying to push any agenda here. For example, I can’t own a house despite having a very high salary but it doesn’t mean I’m not living very comfortably and can afford anything I want and have savings. It also doesn’t mean I’m not unhappy with many things. I’m still recommending Canada for certain people even though I’m planning to leave to the US. It’s just that there’s a lot of nuance involved and I think the hardest thing to grasp for people when it comes to Canada is that it’s different from both EU and US so people who try to think of it from either perspective end up missing the mark.",Lived in Canada for 6 years (3 years in AB and 3 years in QC) and this is the MOST accurate description of Canada,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/15sxsf4/my_thoughts_on_canada_as_someone_who_has_lived/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Imaginary Story: The Irony of Skander’s Ambitions,"Skander is a Tunisian, brown-skinned holder of a master’s degree in medieval history. Despite having no career opportunities in Tunisia, he firmly believes that his degree is internationally recognized and that senior scientists at the CIA are searching for a profile like his to assist them in manipulating world affairs. Skander is convinced that only developed countries deserve his talents, as they are the only ones capable of valuing his strong personality and rare knowledge.

Every morning, Skander receives 10 TND from his hardworking mother to buy cigarettes and coffee, which he uses to spend his day at the neighborhood café. There, he passionately tries to convince his friends that Tunisian girls are opportunistic and that European women are simple, kind, and have an inherent love for Tunisians—especially men like him. According to Skander, these women frequently send him messages on Facebook, inviting him to marry them. Yet, despite these supposed opportunities, he declares that he loves Tunisia too much to leave.

This is Skander’s version of the story. In reality, he has been denied visas by France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Malta, and even Hungary. He was also deported from Serbia when it offered visa-free entry. Skander became depressed, feeling weak and overlooked. One evening, as he sat in his usual spot at the café, watching the 8 PM news on Watania, he saw the president discussing settlement plans for Sub-Saharan immigrants in Tunisia. For the first time, Skander realized that there were people more vulnerable than him, people who sought a better life just as he had once aspired to find in Europe.

Seizing this as an opportunity to project his frustrations, Skander grabbed his phone and began sharing misleading, racist posts and spreading lies to harass Black immigrants.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Why do some regions in Tunisia feel so neglected?,"After spending 20 years living in the capital, I had the opportunity for the first time to study in southern Tunisia, which gave me a chance to experience a different side of the country. Traveling back and forth from Tunis to cities in the south, I noticed a stark contrast: many cities, like Sidi Bouzid, Gafsa, Tozeur, Gabes and Kasserine, seem neglected, with little visible development or investment from the government. 

I don’t understand why these areas are given so little attention, especially since they’re part of Tunisia’s rich history and culture. Sadly, people living in these regions seem to face significant disadvantages. Basic infrastructure is lacking, entertainment options are minimal, and economic opportunities are scarce.

Tunisia,history of Tunisia,Unpopular opinion: carthage and tunisian history,"I believe tunisians shouldn't be proud of the Carthaginian empire, there's not much to be proud of, Carthaginians were outsiders first of all, so why would we be proud of the achievements of another people? I also believe they're not impressive at all and haven't done anything noteworthy, they dominated the Mediterranean only because they were the first to set up colonies all over it, they ended up getting their ass kicked by Rome (which is a superior civilization) 3 times in a row and erased off the face of the earth, they had no army and a weird political system, also they sacrificed babies.

Also, our country isn't 3000 years old, it's at most 1000 years old, that's when the Aghlabid dynasty came around and created the definition of a Tunisian people, which are arabic speaking muslim berbers.

Saying Tunisia is 3000 years old is like saying Germany is 3000 years old or something when the idea of a unified germany is something that came up only in the modern period.

finally you may say why not have the same opinion on the islamic conquests? they are after all outsiders too that came and conquered us.

as I said, the Aghlabid dynasty created the definition of Tunisia as a nation, as we know it today, the islamic conquests is what created us whether you like it or not, it is our true history, and on top of that, only after the islamic conquests we had a chance to govern ourselves (as berbers I mean), under the Zirid and Hafsid dynasties specifically, otherwise berbers were always subjugated by other people, Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines... Not to mention during the middle ages we were prospering like never before, with Kairouan being one of the most developed cities in the Mediterranean.

rant over, I hope you fellas understand.","Look I'm really not liking the new nutjobs who think every Roman monument was actually Carthaginian and just misreading history. However, there are large issues with your take. Carthage were leaders on trade, agriculture, their political system was advanced and participatory, and especially their maritime prowess (and that of their ancestors the Phoenicians) is nothing to scoff at. Rome was a force of nature in terms of conquest, and Carthage still gave them by far the biggest challenge, including laying siege to large parts of their own heartland.  
You attribute the creation of Tunisia as an entity to the Arab muslim conquest, but do you think those borders were random ? Wasn't it ""Ifriqiyya"" simply because it used to be Africa the Roman province, and before that the main territory of Carthage ? This territory has mostly been a single entity since Carthage, and even under bigger empires it still snagged semi-autonomy (Arabs, Ottomans) or at least being a unified subdivision (e.g. a Roman province). In terms of lineage, you're a partial descendant of both, and really mainly an arabized berber. There are many reasons for Carthage's fall, but saying ""Rome was the superior civilization"" is so oversimplified and shallow I'm gonna skip over it. Judging ancient rituals like child sacrifice using modern standards is also not a great idea. Most importantly, with as complex and rich a history as ours, singling out one particular component is just a recipe for dumb takes. Accept all of them, we're the 4th most homogeneous population on earth with no major migratory influxes since the 16th century, it's really baffling just how many are having an identity crisis.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1dbe7ic/unpopular_opinion_carthage_and_tunisian_history/,"Tunis, Carthage, Tunis, Kairouan",Cultural Inquiry,en

I am here today because I want to speak with you about a real high important subject, it's not the classical and not really constructif short-termist comment about the ""Kais Saied Dictatorship Rise"" I prefer to analyse politics in their academic and structural foundations, it's what matter for me, in taking in line the sociological, anthropological, historical, cutlural, economical elements in my approachs. So my discussion will be around the construction of The Tunisian Political Landscape in general and not be related to this a specific temporary probelm of Kais Saied Authoritarism, who is in reality in my personal opinion related to the deficiencies that already happened who lead to this problem.

So I stop to be to long in my introduction and I will enter in the core of my thinking. What is Tunisia ? Tunisia is a Post-Colonial Nation State who is the successor of a an Ottoman Kingdom (Hussainid Dynasty - Ottoman here is not to be taken as a ""Turkish Power Element"" but as Esthetic, Cultural Identity of the form of the State, I personnaly consider the Hussainid Beys as a National Tunisian Sovereign it's my Historic vision each person can have their) and more broadly a Classical Muslim Medieval Dynasty (The Hafsid Kingdom of Tunisia-Ifriqiya), after that Tunisia was a colony of the Francosphere. Tunisian Society is a king of Hybrid Arabic-Berber Nation (Arabic Linguistically Berber Ethnically) who was constructed on a two sided dynamics a densely populated merchant urban north-east/est coast and a classical maghrebian tribal countryside. for Resume Tunisia is a king of Mediterranean Arabo-Berber Nation.

The Country had been ruled from to 1956 to 2011 by the Desoutrians, a kind of Local-Nationalist (Contrary to Umma and Panarabism) Local-Nationalist Secularist Leaning Party who promote a form of authoritarian statist with a strong State who controle the economy with some waves of economic liberalization and privatisation, in the diplomatic fields, the country is globally the Second Arab Switzerland after Oman Historically, we are more NATO Europe America than USSR/Russie/Chine but that's not extravagant. Globally Destourianism is a soft variant of Kemalism without the hatred against our Arabic-Oriental roots and the maintain of Tunisia in the Arabo-Islamic Sphere but with a volontarist social modernity. The First Président was a Charismatic Founder Leader with a very ""The State of change the life of humans"" mindset and the Second President was more a king of Central Asian Autocrate more bling bling, not very ideologically and more ""I am the winner one"". for The economic makeup of Tunisia, Tunisia is globally a Manufactured with Some Tourisme and Agricultural Economy, it means, that it's economy is dependant on the productivity, initiatives and choices of the actors inside the country, I am sorry for my english, but globally Tunisia make her GDP and Money from what her Population produce of their Hands or their minds. So we put the context so now we will pass the most important.

In 2011, a big event take place, we can speak what we want and have a lot of theories (organised coup, Natural uprising, Democratic Middle Class Revolution, Social Unrest by the Countryside peripheries,) anyways this happened and we will let History bring us more detail in the future. This event lead to a complete politicial liberalisation on the country with a loss of a centralised pole of power (for the best or for the worst) and this lead to a situation where the society was in search for herself and her place in the new paradigma with the end of the Party Unique System and the Reign of Political Unicity. we Had 2011, 2014, 2019 legislatives et and presidential elections and this give us a king of general orientations of society ideologies, politicals opinions and orientations. Globally the 2011 election was the Election of the decennies of Frustration, in a context where Arab Spring was seen in large parts of Arab World as a Religious Awakening opportunity accompagne by the ""Ykhafou Rabbi"" ""Yna77iou 3lina El Fsed"" ""Khalli Na3tiwhom 7adhhom"", our Society gave the Islamist (Muslim Brotherhood Section in Tunisia) Party the most big share of vote, if we make a count in term of Ideological Families, we have after that the Social Democracy Family who in cumul was not so far from Ennahdha (CPR Ettakatol, Qotb, PDP) who was the vote of the ""Secular"" Urban Middle Class, infortunately in the case of CPR it was a manipulative party who filled by Nahdhaouis but presented himself as social democrat,)

beforce continuing i will make juste a litte precision : we must put in our minds that there only 3-4 millions Tunisinas who vote regularly, the Populations of Rural Areas and a big part of the Popular Urban Population of Tunis and Sahel don't vote and don't care about politics, Ennahdha for exemple take a lot of popularity from the popular neighborhoods of big cities in 2011 and after little to little lost it for Keeping just South East and Sfax Vote who permit their to stay a relevant Party, in fact the Sociology of Tunisia for me is composed by 3 parts : 33% Urban Middle Class Secular or Not, 33% Popular Urban Class, 33% Rural Peasant Class. the 33% Urban Middle Class are the Core of the Tunisian Voting Machine and are the Base of the Tunisian Politicial Spectrum and Tunisian Political Life surtout after 2014. So Now we go to the 2014 Elections, this Elections was very Interessant and are a big Political Construction ""achievement"" for me in Tunisia because we succed to build with democratical and peacefully means, a bipartisan Political Landscape, a Conservatice Religious Blue Party and a Secular ""Nationalist"" Red Party, after them we little and satellite parties, Afek Tounes (Liberalism) Front Populaire (Radical Left) and Democratic Current (Social-Democracy), for the Slim Riahi Party is can be related to Liberalism but I class this party with the Hechmi Hamdi Nabil Karoui Political Style i Will speak of that Later.

So Globally if we forget the details of reality and we take juste a wikipedia page and watch the results, you will say to yourself, ""Whaou Tunisia have a very modern structured political landscape, it's not the Parliamentary Chaotic Confessionalist Make up of the Electoral Free Arabic Countries like Lebanon, Iraq or Homogenous with non sense like Jordan Kuwait, Maybe Morocco is the sole who have a king of a logical constructed Politcal Landscape"" Globally Tunisia make it to create a Centre-Right vs Centre-Left Political Compass who is you like or not the basis of the Success of Democracy and a Democracy is impossible without parties peu importe what Kais Saied Can Say. So Globally Tunisia Succed to draw a coherent acceptable political Construction, but infortunately, the period of 2014-2019 will be a succession of desillusions and mistakes, the Two Bipartisan Parties make a coalition and kill the Political Antagonism of a naissant democracy (Yes it's cool to be a unified people, but if you want to kill the political attirance for the citizens do that it's best way to kill democratisation) so this period was a catastrophic period in term of general economy (terrorisme, inflation, corruption etc...) without forgetting that the Hopefully Big Secular Party was filled by opportunists, lords wars, distinctive ideological currents, inimity.

so we go for 2019, with a big hatred in the population againist the 2011-2019 ou 2014-2019 ""mandhouma"" and Populism make it with a chaotic vote from the youngs, seriously I say you the truth, i remember it was a kind of ""catalogue des anti systèmes"" and all the young people get attracted by this group of candidates : Kais Saied, Lotfi Mraihi, Safi Said, Makhlouf, I remember all the young on facebook and other social media gathering posting a polls about these candidats and saying ""hey young fellows and guys what we vote for ?"" but it's not just their fault, I remember that the Secular Classical Middle Class Composed of more Adults person divised their votes between Zbidi, Chahed, Moussi, Marzouk (Globally the Nidaa Tounes, Machrou Tounes, Afek Tounes, PDL population) we had Ennahdha who kept the South East with 500 000 voters and maybe gaving some votes to Karama and we Have the Qalb Tounes Nabil Karoui Stuff who is the continuation for me of The Hechmi Hamdi Slim Riahi (he is a rich good men who love the poors and distribute benefits) and for finish we have the Democrat Current (Abbou) who can make a little existence for the Social Democracy.

So We Finished with a complete desagrated Political Spectrum and a multi parts Cake as a Parliament with a President that have nothing to do with the classical Political Landscape, I speak of a Classical Political Landscape because despite all in term of Parliament if we exclude Nabil Karoui Qalb Tounes, and if We don't take in count the multi subdivisions of Parties, we kept a Well Constructed Political Landscape (because the populist young vote all for the presidential 3 800 000 votes and the Parliamentary elections was stay controlled by the classical voters of 2014 and 2011 2 800 000 votes in legislatives only I think) and the problem is that my generation who made that, in reality, a lot of young people insult the boomer mais I find the boomer more rational, because they vote with a real ideological construction (Destourians vs Islamists and some times liberal social democrats and leftis), they don't say ""ah Kais Saied or Safi Said or Lotfi Mrahi look very cool and not corrupt blabla allez go put them president because their are anti system but fuck the parties, (Yes a democracy can work without parties super smart la jeunesse tunisienne), so we had a second tour of election who was a fight between a mass of young people who are mostly gradutated and conscious people who vote for a men who come from nothing without a party againt a corrupt media owner who was voted by old rural poor north-western peasants. It's non sense. Completely non Sense. In fact the probleme that The Tunisian People don't have the Political Construction Rationality in General even they made maybe the best political spectrum of the Arab World in 2014 if we exclude the Slim Riahi Party (So the thing aren't that bad) but in the last paragaphe i Will explain my solutions and vision as a response to all that problematic.

Globally, as i Said, Politics can't be do without real Political Party and Each Political Party must have a men who represent him in the presidential elections, a political life is a structured thing with an permanent antagonism betwwen different compositions of a society who are clear and well structured. We don't vote for a person because he is cool, he love the poors, he have a beautiful face, he is well dress or speak about crazy dreams to people (Safi Said), the politics are a matter of ideologies, a battle of ideas and battle of projects with concrecte and exact positions and doctrines. So for me in Tunisia we must have 5 big parties who represent the 5 big Tunisian Political Families who are serious and historically constructed politcal Families : ISLAMISTS (RIGHT) DESTOURIANS (CENTRE RIGHT) LIBERALS (CENTRE) SOCIAL DEMOCRATS (CENTRE LEFT) RADICAL LEFT AND ARABISTS (LEFT), this is are the Main Political Families in Tunisia for me and The political debat and the Political Life must turn around these families who are for me the Constitutive Elements of the Tunisian Political Life, no Safi Said, no Hechmi Hamdi, no Slim Riahi, no Lotfi Mraihi no no no no please, the Politics isn't a men with a Arabic Middle East accent who was a former Pan-Arabist who make the ""I know all men"" who speak about making Tunisia Singapoura in 3 years, please no. These 5 politcals families must reunites in a Coherent Unified Movements and these 5 can respond to all the desire of each component of the Tunisian Society.

ISLAMIST Family : Ennahdha Party (BLUE) : Islamic Conservatism - Economic Liberalism - Oumma-isme

DESTOURIAN Family : PDL or Simply PARTI DESTOURIEN (VIOLET) : Tunisian Nationalism (No Oumma, No Arabnationalism) - Statism with pragmatic economic Liberalism - Secular Conservatism - Democratic Authoritarism.

LIBERAL Family : Afek Tounes, Al Badil, Tahya Tounes, Machrou Tounes and others all must merge in one Party AL-LIBERALI (YELLOW) ; Secularism, Economic Liberalism, Societal Liberalism, Liberal Democracy, Free Intitiative, Free Economy.

SOCIAL DEMOCRACY Family : Democratic Current (Abbou), Ettakatol, Jomhouri, Al Massar all must merge in one coalition named DEMOCRATE (PINK OR ORANGE) : Secularism, Social-Liberalism, Social-Democracy, Human Rights, Democratism, Mixed Social Economy.

RADICAL LEFT and Arabists Family : Poct, Watad, Ligue Ouvrière, Parti Socialiste, Parti Baas and Others must merge in a one Party rename it Front Populaire ou simply ""YASSAR"" (RED) : Secularism, Anti-Impérialism, Communism, Socialisme, Statism, Arabism, Ecology etc ....

What personnally is the best for me for Tunisia can respond to their problem (be a democracy with a stable economy and stable political situation) globally we need to pass by a ""Erdogan Orban"" Style governing, an authoritarian Democratic Power who pass 20 years to stabilize the country and put the good economic decisions and after we will make a alternance, for me the best Coalition will be a DESTOURIEN-LIBERAL coalition, the Destourian are good for the Authoritarism, the Strong of the State and the Stability (and after all it's the strongest political family in Tunisia demographically and historically) and the Liberal will be here for the Economic Reforms, the Change of the Country Economic System and will be the Democracy and Political Freedoms Garant and Guardian in the Coalition. I know that a lot of here prefere a kind of Liberal-Social Democracy Coalition, but it's impossible, firstly these two families are weak in the Tunisian people (We Need to grow our middle class for having a lot of social democrats and liberals in society) and i thing in this moment that coalition can't do anything. in reality even i am critic of Kais Saied, i think Tunisia must have a Authoritarian Democractic Rule System in the Orban Erdogan Marendra Modi Style, because The Country is weak and need to have a well defined centre of power for create a dialoguer with investors and international partners, we can't and we haven't the ressources to support the deconcentrated parlementarist chaos of 2011-2021 and we must dont go near a Venezeula Model with Kais Saied (We can't say that Erdogan Orban Marendra Modi are like The Maduro System, they arrest press and make offensive speech but they never touch the political pluralism in their countries and never manipulate the electoral system) For Finishing, I think that TUnisian people must have a strong education in Political Sciences and surtout the young people for stopping the populist bullshit ""oui il est propre il est cool on va voter pour lui alors qu'il n'a pas de parti"" de 2019, the politics are avant tout IDEOLOGIES, IDEAS, DOCTRINES. It's impossible to be democratic without parties, Impossible, we had the opportunity to have a political scale similar to Turkiye but we fucked up all. and for the culpability i wear to the young people, i ask juste some rationality, for exemple here you are mostly for a Economic Liberalism and Freedom for the Initiative and less Statism, it's simple you have liberals party, choose the less corrupt (Afek Tounes) et give him the majority, I want that Tunisian people accept the reality of parties and don't be in the populist mood ""they are all thieves blablabla "" and each vote the most party who look like his attentes, for exemple in 2019 the mass of dumb young who vote Kais Saied Safi Said becaue ""they are all thieves et fuck the partys"" in a rational Western Democracy must vote the Democratic Current of Abbou who have a Party Constructed on the ""Anti Corruption, Transparency, Human Rights and Democracy"" vision, maybe we can see what a majority social-democrat governement in Tunisia will give us, here most of you, you must juste vote to Afek Tounes, it's a big Tunisian Serious Liberal Party that exist.

Each Party must have a role for each demand for each Tunisian, Tunisian That love the Islamic Identity, the Islamic Life, the Return of Ottoman Empire vote Ennahdha, Tunisian who are Nationalists and Sovereignists and give a great place the the Idea of a Strong Nation State vote for PDL,, Tunisian like you who are Informaticians, Engineers, Finances etc ... who are young people who want to be winners and earn money without going to Germany France Canada vote Liberal Afek Tounes ou Mehdi Jemma or Chahed or others, Tunisians who love Democracy, Human Rights, Transparency, Institutions Reform, Societal Progressivism vote Social Democracy, Tunisians who want Social Justice, a Strong intervention of State Economically, Redistribution etc ... votre Radical Left. It's all I Finish. I hope I will have interesting Interactiosn with you.","I agree but Tunisia needs to act like Erdogan to free the economy. There is nothing we can do if we keep relying on foreign aid form key states and if we have to rely on the state and stuck (we cannot import for example the state can import for us because of subsidies and capital control)


We need to stabilize our currency without those capital controls which starts with Tunisians believing in the dinar or at least accept to hold it, which they will never do.


The second you tell them exchange it, they will.


If we cannot have a stable economy there is so stable politics. And Tunisians are simply not ready for this if you remove the subsidies people will literally burn down the presidential palace and just as an idea it’s 5% of our gdp and is a burden for the state budget we are taking loans for this shit.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fbxjhi/tunisian_politics_in_general_and_how_tunisians/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sfax",Inquiry,en

Tunisia,ancient ruins,The upside down Rock الحجرة المقلوبة in Sousse,"The inverted rock, also can be translated to  the bottom-up rock or, less informally, the reversed rock, is an ancient ruin located approximately 1km away from the old medina of Sousse. Due to its mysterious monument veiled in local myths and legends, and its underexplored historical significance, this site intrigues visitors.

Local legend suggests that beneath or within the rock lies a vast treasure made of gold.

However, with minimal studies conducted, French historian Georges Daux initially proposed that this structure was part of a dismantled Roman theater. 

Another French historian named Louie Carton conducted further archaeological investigations and disputed the theory, instead suggesting that it may be part of the foundation of a large Roman public bath. Carton's hypothesis was supported by the thermal properties of the building materials and the proximity to a nearby site believed to be remnants of a Roman public bath. Additionally, evidence of an aqueduct was found, indicating water transportation mechanism further evidence for the bath theory.

Furthermore, the site was utilized by the French as a watchtower, humorously dubbed the ""Eiffel Tower.""

I wish our Tunisian archaeologists conducting their own research and excavations using more  modern methods.

I also  hope that the  authorities will take at least  minimal step of adding informational displays to valuarise a bit  this ancient ruin.

Tunisia,ancient ruins,Tunisia is more than just sidi bousaid and few beaches,"I know that historically and aesthetically, Sidi Bou is pleasing. But Tunisia is more than that. 
Why i mentioned this:
First, because 80% of non-tunisian I met know only sidi bou or maybe the beaches.
Second, i noticed that many tunisians start with sidi bou when they want to describe the good places in our country.
I know is mainly the state fault, we don’t have good advertisement for our rich historical places (eljam, dogga, matmata, ..), natural scenery (we have forests, mountains, desert, islands) .. or tourism outside of the summer/beach season.. to the point that even Tunisians don’t know their country. 
While I have no hope for the state to start working on this, I think on smaller scales - from here - to change the perspectives of the people we know, tunisians or not.
What do u think ?","Because all those places are not easily accessible and are far from each other. For comparison if you land in Athens Greece, everything is accessible by public transport, including buses for day trips to other cities.

BISMILLAH  
   
Wednesday the 21 th of september 2022  
\-This is an essay ,  
 \-a confession ,  
 \-a quest for urgent emotional support ,  
 \-a recitation of a dramatic childhood burdened with late night gruesome beating and a life in a poor village of   
قُرًى الساحل التونسي الناتن   
\-A paper that describes the holiness of the adolescence crisis and its devastating impact  on relations with opposite gender , stories that haunted my supposed 8 hours of night sleep   
\-I couragely  decided  to write the truth about my 10 years of brain-devasting time  
 spent roughly in a college that gave me after begging a diploma that continuously ruins my life ,   
\-this is a tale of a social revolution ‘s destructive events  ,   
\-a truly honest picture of a one year experience among the “ghorba “ dommar , events that almost catched my breath   
\-and eventually a complete and honest depiction

Of my addiction  situation …  
\-1:  so to start :   
To me : the best thing is to write , to shout , to yell , to say that your problems are real and not that just :   
يفرجها ربي   
Yeah but no , i mean i suffer , i suffocate , dear Almighty have mercy upon me   
To me also : the worst thing is to lose a part of your beloved diary , your ancient  essays , it just gone by the wind , without you noticing it got burned with flames , your papers lost and gone away in   
بلاد العكري   
\*\* ok now may I start this document , thanks for reading respect and love towards your interest in my suffering :   
\*Part one :   
Hey , i was successfully but not asked for BORN in the late 80s  ,   
an epoque of great mouvements , an era of hope and uncertainty ;   
   
God bless my mother and all yours told me that where i was born the hospital ward was infested with cockroaches ,   
i think one of them was smart enough to enter my little developing brain and cruse it deeply that i became an insane , addict , social failure , black hearted   
(قلب أكحل )   
And indifferent   
(ترما أبرد من فريغو )   
Shout out to my infesting little pet …  
So as to say , the first memory of my life was this : i was about 5 years old and it's most likely the year 1993 ,   
The image i remember : we were till now HAMDOULAH a happy group of people with different ages and conceptions living a middle class neighborhood in a village of east coastal tunisia   
(الساحل التونسي )   
This is a family , and may Almighty bless and conserve yours   
We had like a classic house , the type they call   
دار عربي   
It was and still after 3 decades cosey and lovely ….  
So i remember in our yard me and my brother ( shout out bro) bought a plastic soccer ball from one of the oldest stores in town  , the big Nacer GH a pioneer of our little city in the 90’s , may he RIP   
We brought the ball , entered happily our household , but my beloved grand Pa ( father of my PA) was sitting in a corner sipping concentrated RED tea   
التاي ، شاي أحمر تع المرمجيا    
I think that trash is like meth or crack to them old folks lol   
And he was smoking MARS legères , the famous , plus was enjoying some classic arabic music singing throughout the broken radio ..  
We didn't give a damn about grand PA ( may he RIP i still miss him he was a honest man among filthy people …)  
We went crazy AF , kicking the ball harder than Pele towards the wall and shouting crazy like typical middle class tunisian children ….  
Then sadly my memory starts to blaze and I don't recall what happened next OMG  this is  my cockroach pal  did ate that part from my SD card … oh no :’(   
So i dont keep you longer , apparently what happened next was that grand PA got so upset and took our ball and yelled at as ,   
As you can see its a story without meaning or   
عبرة   
But i will ALWAYS be proud that i did remember my first life scenario that is hamdoulah stuck in my vision ,   
I hope you all conserve those first memories of your beautiful childhood …  
\-part 2 : the second event i remember was that ( no body is perfect , i am squeezing my memory part of the brain to try remember that pop song of 1996 that we used to sing ) while playing in a little so called forest in our neighborhood , like i said we lived in a village not that urbanic ,   
So we were climbing trees singing jumping and stealing Almond   
(اللوز )   
We were three happy and back then caring about each other , neighbors and pals ,   
Sadly all that friendship went flying into air for those who got married , those who immigrated , those who became rich , and those who become a proud and honest addict ,   
Those little scams and troubling we did in the hood are still present in my mind , and everytime i happen to remember em i just burst in the last tears that were left on me ,   
But ok , that's life , nothing is permanent , see patriarch Noah…   
\-Part 3 folks then i will spare you my sickness memories :   
It was about 1997 or so , i had an  uncle ( i still don't like it , he is the type of “SFAXIEN “ life style and thinking \[ no offense and big shout out \]   
So this asswipe convinced my little brain to go with him in a swim with his kids who were also my pals ,   
I knew something wasn't' right but i couldn't resist   
So we hop up into his car that his government institution gave him , it was and old Renauld bull crap vehicle ,   
So we arrive at time at one of the most beautiful beach and sea in Green Tunisia , you might guess ..  
The douche was swimming with his kids , its his right , he didnt care bout my ass and didnt even talked to me , why the fuck you brought me  here asshole ? i could have been playing soccer in the hood   
(بطحة الحومة )   
Or watching saturday’s   
ايقاعات عالمية على قناة 21   
\-okeydoke  ,  I left them happily swimming next to the beach and I entered the sea alone to see what it was like ..  
Beware of whats gon happen ,   
I realised that my feets werent touching the sea ground properly , it was my first attempt to learn to swim , i d be a proud “ SAHLI” but fuck i coudnt do it , so i started to drown , and didnt even had the force to cry for help , and the stupid beach didnt have security punkass guard ,   
I knew it , i was gonna die young , 9 years old maybe , so accepting this fate i started to wave and use my hands to stay on top of the water , it lasted bout couple minutes then my hands gave up so i sadly drowned for a couple of seconds and that FILM of your life cassette  started to roll in my mind , but some grateful guy came out of the blue and holded me up , i was mid unconscious  , so sorry i dont remember the details but i was taken back to the beach and rescued in an “ artisanal” way …  
The douche uncle was happy i was still alive and drove us  back home while i was obnubilated ..   
عمر جديد تكتبلي حمدلله    
When i got home i walked straight to my beloved room , my baby room that kept all my secrets inside its walls , and i started to cry , since i ‘v conceived that what happened was the first shock of real life :   
Life doesn't ‘ hold you like a baby ,  
 life is a silent killer ,   
it gave me mental resistant illness(’es!) ,   
i failed college ,  
 i destroyed many lovely relationships,   
i overdosed , i cried in them dark long nights of rainy winter ,  
 i suffered long term virginty and spent millions dinard in drugs and alcohol in order to forget the awefull pain  ,  
 i made my mother proud and then hopeless ,  
 i remember my poor father crying like a baby when he catched my big brother doing his first cigarette ,   
i hamdoullah got graduated , worked my ass hard in my field , i helped and served hundred of people and i do love all people , i no envy no one , i swear Almighty , i have a good heart , but one day i did a suicide attempt that failed but gave me real sequels , but i learned that , after all these years of suffering , problems , abusing , hard work that the most important thing is   
to FIGHT TO STAY ALIVE ….   
Thanks ,   
Sorry for being that emotional i just wanted to share and maybe help or inspire  others with same issues   
\-i certainly will continue the tale if y’all kindly approve and i have time …  
\-farewell :)))",<3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/xkf246/hey_this_is_my_first_part_of_my_biography_hope/,"Unknown, Tunis, Sfax",General,en
Tunisia,ancient ruins,ChatGPT Poem about Tunisia 🇹🇳,"Tunisia, land of ancient history,
With vibrant culture and rich legacy,
Where the Mediterranean sparkles bright,
And the sun shines on the desert's might.

In the bustling markets of Carthage town,
The smells of spices fill the air around,
The ancient ruins stand proud and tall,
A testament to Tunisia's rise and fall.

From the Saharan dunes to the northern coast,
Tunisia is a land of contrasts boast,
With vibrant cities, fertile plains and hills,
And rolling coastline dotted with fishing mills.

The Berber people, proud and free,
Preserve the traditions of their ancestry,
With colorful dress and music that rings,
Telling tales of Tunisia's past, culture and king.

Where the people are warm and the hospitality bountiful,
A treasure trove of adventure, waiting to be explored,

We have tried to search for information about them, but have only found some local people who said that were a dwelling for an ancient Arab philosopher. We have been unable to find any more information about it.

I am hoping that someone on this board might know, of might be able to tell me where to find such information.

Thank you.","Al-Ghadamsi is not a philosopher, he is a cleric who lived during the rule of the Almoravid state in the eleventh and twelfth centuries AD.  
He was buried there, leaving nothing but his foundations, and the island of pigeons in which pigeons nest in abundance  
The island of Abu al-Fadl al-Ghadamsi, along with the island of al-Hamam and the island of al-Naf, and after that the islands of Greater and Lesser Kuria, all of them are a public maritime property registered to the Tunisian state and owned by it alone.  
In general, it is an island full of stones that Tunisians go to to jump and swim in the sea

I also believe they're not impressive at all and haven't done anything noteworthy, they dominated the Mediterranean only because they were the first to set up colonies all over it, they ended up getting their ass kicked by Rome (which is a superior civilization) 3 times in a row and erased off the face of the earth, they had no army and a weird political system, also they sacrificed babies.

Also, our country isn't 3000 years old, it's at most 1000 years old, that's when the Aghlabid dynasty came around and created the definition of a Tunisian people, which are arabic speaking muslim berbers.

Saying Tunisia is 3000 years old is like saying Germany is 3000 years old or something when the idea of a unified germany is something that came up only in the modern period.

finally you may say why not have the same opinion on the islamic conquests? they are after all outsiders too that came and conquered us.

as I said, the Aghlabid dynasty created the definition of Tunisia as a nation, as we know it today, the islamic conquests is what created us whether you like it or not, it is our true history, and on top of that, only after the islamic conquests we had a chance to govern ourselves (as berbers I mean), under the Zirid and Hafsid dynasties specifically, otherwise berbers were always subjugated by other people, Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines... Not to mention during the middle ages we were prospering like never before, with Kairouan being one of the most developed cities in the Mediterranean.

rant over, I hope you fellas understand.","Look I'm really not liking the new nutjobs who think every Roman monument was actually Carthaginian and just misreading history. However, there are large issues with your take. Carthage were leaders on trade, agriculture, their political system was advanced and participatory, and especially their maritime prowess (and that of their ancestors the Phoenicians) is nothing to scoff at. Rome was a force of nature in terms of conquest, and Carthage still gave them by far the biggest challenge, including laying siege to large parts of their own heartland.  
You attribute the creation of Tunisia as an entity to the Arab muslim conquest, but do you think those borders were random ? Wasn't it ""Ifriqiyya"" simply because it used to be Africa the Roman province, and before that the main territory of Carthage ? This territory has mostly been a single entity since Carthage, and even under bigger empires it still snagged semi-autonomy (Arabs, Ottomans) or at least being a unified subdivision (e.g. a Roman province). In terms of lineage, you're a partial descendant of both, and really mainly an arabized berber. There are many reasons for Carthage's fall, but saying ""Rome was the superior civilization"" is so oversimplified and shallow I'm gonna skip over it. Judging ancient rituals like child sacrifice using modern standards is also not a great idea. Most importantly, with as complex and rich a history as ours, singling out one particular component is just a recipe for dumb takes. Accept all of them, we're the 4th most homogeneous population on earth with no major migratory influxes since the 16th century, it's really baffling just how many are having an identity crisis.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1dbe7ic/unpopular_opinion_carthage_and_tunisian_history/,"Tunis, Carthage, Tunis, Kairouan",Cultural Inquiry,en

Tunisia,Carthage history,"Our ancestors were traders, we should built massive ports and engage in trading. ","I think whoever is in power in Tunisia should prioritize reducing tariffs to make it more affordable to import goods. Lowering these taxes would not only enrich our domestic markets but also strengthen Tunisia’s position as a trading hub between Africa and Europe. We should build, or even revive, a major port like the ancient port of Carthage to support this vision. Our strategic location, overseeing both the western and eastern Mediterranean and in close proximity to Europe, is a unique asset that few countries share. By easing tariffs, fostering strong trade partnerships, and investing in infrastructure, Tunisia could play a crucial role in global trade, attracting business and boosting economic stability. With a history rooted in Carthaginian trade, Tunisia has the potential to become a leading Mediterranean gateway for commerce.

Tunisia,Carthage history,"Tunisia Solo Female Trip Report: Budget, Highlights, Safety, Tips","Hi Tunisia! I (32F) wanted to share my solo trip experience to help future travelers. It's a long one so feel free to skip my post but I know a lot of people come here asking some questions

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,Carthage history,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Tunisia,Carthage history,First impression of Tunisia… from an outsider.,"I’m Indonesian, and I just visited Tunisia at the end of last year (which was one week ago) to visit my boyfriend’s family. Tunisia is very beautiful. The coastline? Breathtaking. The hills around Tunis that you can see from the Highway? Beautiful. The food? Amazing. The seafood? SCRUMPTIOUS. Here are some positive things I really loved:

1. People are extremely friendly:
We went to the market and bought some stuff for New Year’s Eve. At the butcher, the man asked me where I’m from and he said welcome. The fruit-veggie seller said welcome and even wanted to give me the veggies for free (I rejected, of course). The guy at the Bourguiba Museum said welcome and told me that it’s fascinating that Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. People are so friendly!
2. Amazing food scene:
I am Indonesian - I love spicy food! I think I’ve been eating so much. I love the seafood, it’s so fresh and reminds me of home. I love the sweets. The portions are also huge - this part is when my boyfriend steps in and would help finish my food!
3. Great entertainment:
Coffee shops, bars, all these things are important for me. I love how it’s very open. So much music, dancing - or even just to hang out and talk with your friends. It’s very nice to see these places all lively and crowded, especially on weekends.
4. Rich culture and history:
I went to the Museum in Bardo and in Sousse. Both museums are amazing. So much history, and as a history nerd, I was so delighted to see that they are preserved. These are the things that Tunisia, as a country, needs to protect as Tunisia has thousands of years of rich history. The guide we had in Bardo was super nice and gave us a thorough explanation on Tunisian history. 

But, here are some negative things I noticed:
1. Lack of public transportation:
See, as an Indonesian, I can’t really criticize Tunisia on this, but considering the fact that Tunisia is rather small compared to Indonesia, I think the country can do so much better.
I took the SNCFT from Sousse to Tunis. The train arrived (30 mins late), I cannot help but notice that the trains are very similar to what we used to have before a massive transformation around a decade ago.
The Tunis-Carthage airport is also chaotic. I really love the architecture inside, I find it very original, but I find it too chaotic - too many staffs, they change gates without prior notification, etc. 
This lack of public transport is then added up by another issue, which is the fact that cars are heavily taxed. My boyfriend’s mom thought that I am very rich because I have my own car in Indonesia. I am not. When I heard that my tiny, €6.5k car costs almost €8.5k in Tunisia, I was shook. How are people supposed to transport themselves if cars are very expensive but yet public transport is severely lacking?
2. Lack of digitalization:
When I asked my boyfriend if we could buy the train tickets online, he laughed. I also had to stick to cash - I’ve never handled cash, ever. In Indonesia, we pay with bank apps and e-wallet apps by scanning QR Codes. In Tunis, my card got declined 3 times - there was not even a notification that the transaction failed, which means that the card machine didn’t even work.

Negative sides aside, I had an amazing time in Tunisia. Will definitely re-visit sometime in the Summer! 3aychek!","I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip, and we hope you come visit us again.  
Yes, we have been suffering from public transportation for decades, and no one has yet found a solution (this includes the bus, the train, the metro and even Tunisair flights-planes).

However, using cards to pay is not yet a culture here, you can say that all Tunisians must have cash to shop comfortably, but we are getting better day by day (but slowly), we mostly use cards to extract cash from ATM.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1913psr/first_impression_of_tunisia_from_an_outsider/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage",General,en

Tunisia,Carthage history,History massacre in Tunisia ,"In recent months, I've noticed a wave of historical misconceptions circulating on social media, from a range of sources, even 'respectable', as far as social media goes, influencers or social media personas.  
And the most notable giant pieces of shit that really piss me off as a history buff are : 

1- The Caspian culture is being called the oldest civilisation in the world, I don't know who started this shit but people calling it a civilisation is a giant horse shit. 

2- The widespread narrative among Tunisian wannabe intellectuals is that we are Carthaginians, and from the beginning the use of this word is incredibly wrong in many ways, people don't understand that Carthage was just a city-state and the empire that it created was mostly a dominance over other smaller cities and settlements, it was not a single contagious entity and it is definitely not a cultural defence, if you want to be at least a little bit right say Punic as that was the common identity, fu. In fact, some other Punic cities turned against Carthage in the last Punic war and sided with the Romans and they kept that Punic identity for centuries and didn't suffer the same fate as Carthage, most notably Kerkouan. 

3- Roman denialism, many Tunisians want to deny that the Roman Empire left a huge mark in Tunisia and the Romans (before the fall) ruled the area we call Tunisia now for almost 600 years and extra 200 with the Byzantine Empire, I even saw many many people claiming the el djem amphitheatre as ""Carthaginian"".

4- The Arab vs Berber (Amazigh) debate which mostly takes a political/religious turn, people deny the existence of the other, some go full Arab on one side saying there is no such thing as Berber and others claim we are not Arabs we are Amazigh and they do this shit while twisting history as they wish and it's not even clean clever twisting it's literally spitting vomit. 

Have you noticed this?
 Do you think this is all because of our shitty shallow history programme we have?","Prepare for the rant.

I noticed that for sure. They are partially a result of a crappy attempt at nation building by Bourguiba following independence which leaves people confused about history.

1- The Capsian culture in our text books is called الحضارة القبصية which literally translates to the ""Capsian civilization"". It might seem like a small change, but it has wide implications on how people perceive it. When you hear civilization you don't think of a barely Neolithic semi-sedentary society of hunters, you think of a complex society like Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. The thing is when the Capsian culture was flourishing, Egypt and the Fertile Crescent were already home to societies practicing extensive agriculture and moving towards the development of complex society and civilization, while the Capsian culture can't really be described as anything close to that. They didn't even have significant agriculture, their diet was more hunting-based, they had no evidence of complex political structures ... Agriculture actually came pretty late to the Maghreb, probably from Iberia during the Middle to Late Neolithic.

2- When it comes to Carthage, our text books depict it as the ""us"", they are not just a state whose capital happened to be within the modern borders of Tunisia, they are literally our predecessors and ancestors, they are THE ""ancient Tunisians"". Of course that notion is beyond ridiculous, the average Carthaginian would have felt more affinity to someone from Tyre than to a Berber speaker from Gafsa for example (most Tunisians don't even know that Punics literally called themselves just ""Canaanites"", they didn't see themselves as any different from people in Palestine or Lebanon). But that fact makes us unsecure so we start inventing imaginary links to Carthage as well as re-interpreting them to fit into our modern views of who we want them to be (I noticed a lot of that in this sub too to the point I made this [post](https://new.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/14drorv/tunisiancarthaginian_continuity_why_its_not_true/) on r/badhistory about it). The fact of the matter is we have little to nothing left from the Punics, not in our dialect, not in our traditions, and not in our identity. Punic culture was something archeologists started digging in the 19th and 20th century and decades of constant ""let's learn about Carthage"" lessons from primary to secondary school indoctrinated us to feel an affinity to them.

3- Within that same context, our text books focus very little on the Roman period, and almost nothing on the Vandal, Byzantine or Christian periods. Within our historical narrative, the Romans are seen as an invader who extinguished ""the us"" that is Carthage with whom we identify. Thus almost 700 years of very significant influence are brushed under the rug. People fall so easily for those people saying ""actually the Romans didn't build this amazing monument, they just appropriated it"" and ""actually the Romans just copied Punic agricultural practices"" because they are conditioned to regard the former as the ""invaders"" and we certainly don't want to give them any credit, instead we want to prove that they are the ones who actually needed us. Of course, this runs counter to reality. The Roman period is arguably the second most important external influence on our country (right after the Arab one). And a culture of Latin-speaking Roman-identifying Christian Africans developed within the boundaries of our country and is an integral part of our history that we rarely if ever bring up.

4- And finally, the Arab-Berber issue. The last chapter of ""our history"" (outside of the modern era of course) in school text books is the Arab conquest. Arabs came, they fought the evil pagan Berbers, killed the traitorous snake Kusaila and that witch al-Kahina and established our current Tunisian Muslim culture. That framing leaves us with a lot of questions. Why are the Berbers (one of, if not THE largest component of our culture) ignored and regarded as an ""other"" that we should be happy was cast off by outsiders ? Why are we glorifying invaders now when we just regarded the Romans as evil invaders ? Also there are tons of holes in the narrative, like for example it doesn't explain how we became Arabic-speaking and Muslim to this degree (as in 99%+). Many people try to fix those holes using outside sources, which lead them to reach a conclusion that I think still misses a lot of important details and over simplifies everything in favor of another hero vs villain story just inverted which is the Berberist narrative that Arabs were this murderous horde of invaders who forced everyone to speak their language and adopt their religion, while the Berber resistance was this valiant group of people defending their identity and culture from barbarians.

The reality of the matter of course is neither narrative captures what really happened as the Arab conquests just started a slow and gradual process of islamization and arabization (except for the current religious landscape of a Tunisia devoid of any native Christian presence is almost entirely a result of a mass expulsion of Christians by the Almohads following Norman rule). The linguistic shift for example took place within various stages, for instance there was the Aghlabid stage where a core of urban centers grown around garrison cities radiated their influence (and their perceived high culture) into other urban areas and certain rural areas, and a post-Zirid stage of Arab tribes like Banu Hilal and Banu Salim gradually assimilating various local Berber tribes within their tribal confederacies and creating a source of prestige genealogy built around characters in epics like Taghribat Banu Hilal that everyone tried to link themselves to.

Within our national consciousness though, the Aghlabids aren't really thought of beyond a few of their building projects in Kairouan, even though modern Maghrebi high culture is a fusion of the culture they created and Andalusian elements that arrived gradually with refugees from Andalusia following the Reconquista. The Hilalian migrations on the other hand are looked down upon as a source of scourge and destruction based on nothing more than Ibn Khaldun's prejudiced views as a urbanite living centuries after the fact (plus a bit of orientalism from the French who attributed ""agricultural decline"" to them). And the Almohad period isn't really talked about in terms of how it made us the only part of the Arab world (as in the Maghreb) with no native Christian population despite the massive impact that had on us and our collective self perception.

By the time we reach the Hafsid and Ottoman period, we entered early modern history where it is supposed that ""we figured out who we are"", when in reality the narrative we are presented is a mishmash of facts with illogical framing that simply leaves us confused even more. A very important paradox is the one where our national narrative is about us becoming Arabs but at the same time not being Arabs. This was the result of Bourguiba wanting to create a state modelled after the French model with one official language so he focused on Arabic but at the same time he opposed Pan-Arabism (within the context of cold war era politics) so his regime attempted to instill this notion that ""we are so unique, we were influenced by Punics, Romans, Berbers, Arabs, Turks ... unlike Libyans and Algerians who ... you know ... weren't"".

To prove we are a population with an identity crisis you can just look at the [Arab Barometer's poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/arabs/comments/103c5dg/arab_barometer_what_is_your_ethnicity/) on ethnicity in the Arab world. Most people understood the question to be about language (which in my opinion is logical) so all countries had results that match their linguistic landscape. The only exception was Tunisia, where a third used the linguistic definition, a third identified as something else, and another third said they don't know. Our education system tried to create a cohesive national identity and instead created a society where the average person is just confused.

Today with social media, the situation got even worse as now people's self perception is so easily molded by the last thing that appeared on their feed. And add to that how a ton of ""trained historians"" in the Arab world are frankly unacademic at best and pseudo-historical at worst.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1beywdu/history_massacre_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Carthage",Cultural Inquiry,en

Tunisia,Carthage history,VISTING TUNISIA IN APRIL,"Hello Guys i am planning to visit next April and i wanted to share my plan with you so far

We are a Group of 4 guys we are 25 we like history and nature in the morning and day and party at night so i was wondering can we do this plan and what are the good places to drink and have fun at night

This our plan in Wanderlog :

[https://wanderlog.com/view/phzkstsbgg/trip-to-tunisia/shared](https://wanderlog.com/view/phzkstsbgg/trip-to-tunisia/shared)

From Day 1 To Day 6 will be staying in **La Marsa** & From Day 7 To Day 10 In **Sousse** Or **Monastir** and is it worth it to extend it to 14 days ?

&#x200B;

1. **settling down & Sidi bou said**
2. **Carthage**
3. **medina Tunis**
4. **Ghar al Milh & Bizerte**
5. **Bulla Regia &  Dougga**
6. **Uthina & Thuburbo Majus & The Water Temple**
7. **Hammamat**
8. **Tour of the cape bon**
9. **sousse & monastir**
10. **El jam &  Kairouan**

**i am very happy to hear all opinions about the plan and changes Thankyou.**

PS we speak little Arabic","Looks nice. How are you getting around? Driving in Tunis and Sousse can be pretty hard for people not used to it. Cars in front always have priority, and people tend to only use turn signals when they do something *really* weird like decide they want to stop suddenly in the left lane on a highway. No one ever signals for eg a lane change, they just kind of push their car left or right, slightly slower than how Europeans change lanes but you have to read the body language of the car. It’s pretty obvious after 30 min of driving, but I wouldn’t recommend those first 30 min to be in Tunis on morning rush hour going from La Marsa to Bulla Regia.

Bulla Regia and Dougga are both a pretty far drive from La Marsa and you’re unlikely to spend more than an hour and a half at either - definitely not more than an hour and a half at Bulla Regia. Dougga is a massive site but most people can only look at ruins for so long, unless they’re archaeologist level of interested. Both are very different and pretty neat; Bulla Regia is in an Ireland-style green countryside, with crazy underground Roman mansions still in good condition (you can still go downstairs, just look around a bit, at least 3 are open). Dougga is in a bit more stereotypical Mediterranean-style countryside, but still very green and hilly and pretty. If you really like ruins do both. Otherwise you could overnight at El Kef, which is kinda neat, and saves you having to backtrack all the way to La Marsa. 

For going out to party, I think Gammarth is the only real option? Like there are other places you can get a beer, but Tunisia isn’t exactly Ibiza, especially in April. I’m sure there’s stuff in the tourist zones like Yasmine Hammamet and Port El Kantaoui, but I’ve never been to either and personally I wouldn’t touch a tourist zone with a 100 foot pole, but some people seem to like them. Too many drunken Brits and Germans for me to want to get close to them - but fortunately they self-quarantine in those resorts and the worst ones tend not to infect the outside world. 

Get the Bradt guide to Tunisia if you haven’t already. 

Also I hope ""in April"" means ""entirely after Ramadan"". If next April means 2025 then wow you’re planning crazy far in advance, but then you definitely wouldn’t have to deal with Ramadan. ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1b51nyo/visting_tunisia_in_april/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage, Monastir, Bizerte, Kairouan",General,en
Tunisia,Carthage history,Travelling to Tunis this winter! Any tips?," Hi All!

After a few years of interest in Carthage, I have finally  gotten around to booking the flights to Tunis this Winter!  :)

Tunisia,Carthage history,Do you think that one day The (little) Magreb will be united?,"Hello to everyone, and Eidkom Mabrouk

I have this question because during the Aïd, I wasn't in Tunisia due to studies, so I fested with 2 friends, one from Algeria and the other from Morocco.

We all are studiying law, and when we have time we do what's called a debate: We take a subject  and we have like an ""abitre"" one for, and one against . Since we fested Aïd together, we took time to do one.

And the question was: Do you think that Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will be one day one country ?

I was designated as the against part, the moroccan girl in favour part and the algerian the abitre.( it doesn't represent our personnal beliefs)

We had a good debate, althought at the end I won, the abitre told us that it was really hard to take a side, she had a lot of good arguments.( He didn't took the decision with his beliefs, but more about the justess of our arguments and our charisma let's say)

I was thinking about it  and I wanted to have your thoughts about this question ( I'm asking as well other countries in question  about it ? )","No, 'Magreb' is boring, restore Carthage.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/uic5vz/do_you_think_that_one_day_the_little_magreb_will/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,Carthage history,Seeking advice for a 7 day trip... in December,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a guy from Singapore who will be visiting in mid-December with my brother. Currently we study in France and the UK. We both love history and archaeology (museums, material culture, visiting sites), trying new food, and meeting new people to learn and exchange information. My brother is also into wildlife photography, although I suppose December is off-season.

 Currently, we're thinking of flying into (and maybe out of?) Tunis. Unfortunately neither of us drive, but we're down to catch a bus/louage/taxi/train as needed. 

I had this itinerary in mind, but wanted to check in with the far more knowledgeable people over here if this seemed like a doable plan, or if there are improvements that could be made! 

**Day 1:** Fly into Tunis; see the Bardo Museum + Medina

**Day 2:**  Day trip to Sidi-bou-Saïd 

**Day 3:** Day trip to Carthage

**Day 4:** Day trip to Dougga 

**Day 5:** Louage (?) to Sousse, see Archaeological Museum

**Day 6:** Day trip to Kairouan 

**Day 7:** Day trip to El Jem. 

**Day 8:** Fly out of Monastir (?) 

A few questions. 

1: As you can see, we are basing ourselves in Tunis for four nights and Sousse for three - would you recommend this? 

2: Are there places to see wildlife in winter? The Ichkeul National Park looks lovely but seems out of the way, and possibly not that active in December. 

3:  What would you suggest we do in Tunis/Sousse in the evenings/nights? I'd love to check out any art centers or any interesting things that are going on. 

4: Anything food-wise that's underrated which I should try? I love the few times I've tried Tunisian food here in France, but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg.

5: What would you recommend I read or watch to learn about Tunisia? Academic books are fine, blogs are wonderful. My French is not fantastic, and neither my brother or I speak Arabic, so sadly English resources are preferable. 

Thanks in advance to everybody! I hope one day I can repay back anything I've learnt here - if you have any questions about Singapore, or England/Paris where we studied/are studying, for instance, I would be happy to have them. 

P.S. /u/scafidi_travels has produced such amazing resources! His playlists are so in-depth, but I don't have a good sense of how these fit into an itinerary where I won't rent a car. 

Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm doing anything stupid!

Tunisia,Carthage history,"When All Was Lost, We Had Our Letters","I recently wrote an article about Tifinagh, one of the oldest alphabet in history - and our Amazigh heritage -, which has defied those who have attempted to suppress our identity over time.

Tunisia,Carthage history,Why doesn't tunisia promote/advertise their historical sites for tourism?,"I'm from norway and im taking a bachelor in history, currently second year, i want to write my final thesis on carthage as when i studied roman history i fell in love with hannibal and carthaginian history as a teenager. I knew about a lot of the historical facts but actually i had no idea about especially the ROMAN sites in tunisia, untill i visited 3 times the last 10 months due to my fiance being from tunisia. I knew about the carthage ruins, which are cool for someone especially interested like me and bardo museum is great too but for standard tourists i dont think they would care that much. However you have hidden gems. Everyone knows about the colosseum, rome is already an incredibly popular tourist destination and of course theres more to rome than colosseum, but the point is its a very popular destination. I study carthaginian and roman history and i had no idea el jem existed untill a year ago. I was lucky to visit december last year and it blew my mind. Its basically just a slightly smaller colosseum, a bit worse shape but even when i visited there was workers there doing renovation work, and yes i know i visited during corona but that place was EMPTY. like it was me, my fiancee, the workers and maybe 4-5 other people. Colosseum is completely full at all times, and i believe theres reasons for this. First of all of course rome is way more accesible, we reached el jem on a 2.5ish our drive from tunis, and the rest of el jem is nothing, like its just a town that has NOTHING in it except for the amphiteatre, while rome has so much more to offer than just the colosseum. I have been in hammamet and sousse and i have seen what kind of infrastructure and tourist friendly enviorements tunisians can create, but tunisia in my opinion is so much more than 5 star hotels and beaches? If you built some resturants, did some promoting, anything around your historical past you could attract so many tourists, at least thats my opinion. Tourists come to norway and scandinavia in general all the time due to our beautiful nature and our viking history, and we also promote that, of course due to the recent success of viking entertainment on tv everything has been more well known, but i really believe if tunisia made an effort they could profit hugely and also create a lot of jobs.

Sure pure blooded amazigh people are rare in Tunisia but still many of us have more amazigh dna than arab. I feel like they fear if we identify as non arab that means we are drifting from identifying as muslims  but islam is a religion after all we can be amazigh muslims and the amazigh themselves have been adapting since the beginning with every religion concurred north Africa through out history even when they already had their own gods themselves, heck they still call them berbers when the Amazigh don't like that name its offensive as the Romans called them that to dehumanize them",Divide and Conquer.,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jj2hs6/now_i_think_about_tunisia_has_really_been/,"Tunis, Tunis, Carthage",General,en

Tunisia,Carthage history,Carthage in Modern-day Tunisia,What do Tunisians think of Carthage and Carthagian civilization ?,"Just like how Egyptians think of their ancient Egyptian fathers how how Iranians think of their ancient Persian empires and how the Greeks think of the ancient Greeks especially Alexander III of Macedon and how Italians think of the Romans.

We're proud of our history, every bit of it, and I have heard plenty of times people saying about Tunisian ""3000 thousands of years of civilization"" which means that Tunisia starts with the Carthaginian era, in fact the Carthaginians are very close to us, they were a Semitic speaking people with a Semitic culture just like the Arabs, if you think about the ancient names of Carthaginian cities you will find out that it's very similar and almost the same with Arabic words, (Utika = Atika, Qart Hadasht = Qarya Haditha etc...) even though both the Arabs and the Carthaginians didn't leave plenty of descendants but their culture is still alive.

We name our towns, schools, streets etc... with Carthaginian names, I personally go to a secondary school named Hannibal which in Carthage city and next to my secondary school is an elementary school named Tanit in the Tanit Avenue, we have Carthage plus TV channel and the presidential Palace is a.k.a Carthage Palace.

But unlike the Egyptians, Iranians, Persians, Greeks and Italians, we aren't descendants of Carthaginians or at least the most of us aren't, we are like the Turkish people who are proud of their Hittite history but they don't consider themselves Hittites and so it's kind of stupid to consider ourselves Neo-Carthaginians because we're mostly Amazigh and whether we like it or not Carthaginians are from Lebanon and they occupied an Amazigh land but still we're proud of our Carthaginian civilization, it would make sense for Arab Tunisians to consider themselves related to the Carthaginians because like I mentioned before they are both Semitic peoples from the Levant but most of us are Amazighs and this doesn't stop us from being proud of our history, this includes the Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Turks etc...

They are all part of our history and we modern Tunisians need to move on and not focus too much on history, I had a teacher who called Carthage empire a colonization and there was a political party that wanted to build another Carthaginian state, this is all stupid and we need to avoid going to both of these extremes, it's all history and chasing the past will only harm us , we need to accept our differences and focus on building up this country.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jhziik/carthage_in_modernday_tunisia/,"Tunis, Carthage, Tunis, Carthage",General,en

Tunisia,Carthage history,[Question] Why does Tunisia have such a high percentage of educated joining ISIS?,"First off, my father is Tunisian and my mother is Swedish.

I've always been extremely proud of my Tunisian heritage, I still am. From the early history of the Phoenicians travelling to the cape of africa to the north of europe, to Carthage and Hannibals father founding Barcelona. 

Hell, Tunisia gave women the right to vote over 20 years ahead of portugal and sweizz. And the university-graduation levels are on par with Sweden which is quite amazing considering the history of ben ali.

So I must ask; **How is it that there are so many educated tunisians joining ISIS?** My father couldn't answer me when I asked this, he didn't even know the statistics and found it strange. As do I, because from everything I've experienced of tunisia it's a great, open and somewhat secular country. 

[So why do some decide to join ISIS?](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-so-many-of-tunisias-youth-are-drawn-to-isis-2014-10?IR=T) I want to know what down to earth tunisians in tunisia have to say about this

I am also curious as to how ISIS is percieved in tunisia, since from all that I've read people seem to not think to badly of ISIS. I know that all stories have two sides, just look at russia-today, al-jazeera, and CNN covering stories and you see widely different views. But from all the news I gather ISIS seems to be such a horrid party, worse so than saudi arabia, qatar etc. and I've lived a year in Saudi-Arabia and I hate that country with a passion.

It all just seems so weird to me that the tunisia I love, the tunisia I am proud of, somehow also is the biggest source of isis jihadists in the muslim world.

Tunisia,Kairouan mosque,Louage network information?,"Is there some sort of list or map of all direct Louage routes with approx prices and first/last departure?

It's kind of hard to plan a day trip using them if you don't have an idea of how long it will take to travel (ie. if you need to stop in another city and how long you need to wait for it to go).

Also, how late do they usually run, I don't want to get stranded somewhere.

And the route costs.  I want to avoid getting alot of cash.

For me, I will be in Tunis and specifically want to visit El Jem and Kairouan (on 25 April). Also Uthina too if there's time.  I figure like 2hrs or so for each location.  If there are direct routes between each, it would make the most sense to goto Uthina, then Kairouan, then El Jem, then back.  Or the whole thing in reverse.  However, I believe the Mosque in Kairouan closes around 2pm.  I think the other places probably close around 5pm.  Another option is to take the train, I think there is a very early one that leaves like 6am gets to El Jem around 10am which should leave plenty of time to get to Kairouan and Uthina.

I've visited the colosseum in rome.  I guess this is smaller but cheaper and more accessible and I can see underground.

Tunisia,Kairouan mosque,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

3. Local experiences: I am interested in unique and authentic experiences that will give me a taste of the local lifestyle. From food to shopping, I would love suggestions on what not to miss in Tunisia.

I am excited to explore Tunisia and can't wait to hear your recommendations. Thank you in advance!","1- Sidi Bou Said / Carthage / Medina Arbi / Sousse and Hammamet although they are known for their beaches still they got old Medinas and Great bars / Tabarakah and Ain Drahem for natural beauty / Star Wars Movie set in the south / Djerba Island.

2- 30$-50$ would be enough a day if you are traveling alone, though if you are planning to stay in a pretty luxurious hotel and eat at luxurious restaurants the cost might go up.

3- You will see the Local Culture in The Medina Arbi in Tunis, I say plan a full day or two just going around there and tasting different kinds of food (try Lablebi / Kafteji / Cousksi with fish / Frikase / Brik...)

Tunisia,Berber villages,What were/are the main Imazighi tribes in Tunisia?,"So I believe that roughly the average Tunisian is about 60-80% indigenous northwest African, 10-30% Banu Hilal, and the rest Southern European, levantine and West African, I could say the Southern European is mainly Sardinian, Sicilian, Iberian and from the Romans, the levantine is mainly Jewish and from Phoenicians, the West African is probably largely fula and haratin, but what is the Berber, are we zenati, Chaoui, Tuareg? 

Do we even know ourselves? My grandma's have the face tattoos and wear traditional Berber clothing but even they can't tell me what tribe we are from.

This is going to be just before Ramadan so would be a great time to get together and eat and drink while we still can.  

Some ideas:

Bardo Museum: Attendance has been down since the attacks and it would be great to go and show solidarity for the country and against the terrorist trying to scare people away

Cooks: [A good restaurant in Sidi Bou Said](https://www.facebook.com/cooksfood?fref=ts).

Golden Cafe: [Another good place for food](https://www.facebook.com/GoldensCafe?fref=ts)

[Berber Village](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293758-d7197902-Reviews-Berber_village-Tunis_Tunis_Governorate.html) Not sure what this place is but sounds interesting.  Thoughts?

I will also try to get some playing cards (If you have some, let me know) so we can play some cards.  I can teach some games like No Limit Texas Hold 'em, Go Fish, Rummy, or Bullshit (Can be called Liar if played in public).  If anyone has any board games (scrabble, settlers of catan, Ticket to ride, that sort of thing) please let us know.

We had 3 people the first and I think 4 the second.  I'd like to see a lot more people, like 10.

Tunisia,Tunisian cuisine,rant about our neighbors' blatant chauvinism,"Every single Tunisian nugget of content on social media is bombarded by swarms of Algerian/Moroccan (esp Algerian) commentators. Fine. There's too many of them and they're naturally curious. The more the merrier. Sure, the takes are everywhere from lovely, unrestrained appreciation, to hollow calls for ""Re-islamification because Tunisians are such degenerates wow look at us we are such good and proper muslims because so and so."" 

Anyways. That's not the point. My gripe is especially with other north africans who comment on cooking videos made by Tunisian content creators. This Ramadhan, I've noticed a surge of regional influencers advocating for their regions' cultures. Which is refreshing compared to the tired post covid trends of Tunisian influencers shilling middle eastern cuisine and posting their recipes for kunefe, tabboule, or ye olde westernized garbage. It was genuienly beautiful to witness so many creators unearthing ""zemni"" Tunisian recipes (sweet and savory) and it made me yearn for grandma's 5obz f tabbouna. I think it's also not new information that every Tunisian region has their own unique take on Couscous based on that region's history and norms etc. 

Every single one of these videos has dozens if not hundreds of our neighbors' (espECIALLY ALGERIANS) claiming that these recipes are stolen or inspired or ripped off of their national dishes. ~~It's actually tiresome and disheartening in the sense that an entire population cannot conceive of the simple anthropologic concept that communities who exist in SIMILAR TOPOLOGICAL/GEOGRAFICAL LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR VARIETY IN PRODUCE will eventually create similar looking dishes and LET'S NOT FORGET THE SEAMLESS MIGRATION/TRADE MOVEMENTS THAT HAS LONG EXISTED IN NORTH AFRICA FOR THERE TO BE A CLEAR CONTINUITY BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS/ETHNICITIES/RACES HERE.~~

Tunisia,Tunisian cuisine,"Tunisian ""Original"" Recipes","Asleema all,

I've been trying to develop my Tunisian cooking range, and the more I look into it, the more I find there are many differing suggestions on what is a true/typical Tunisian recipe vs what has been changed or modified. As such I was wondering if people in this community knew or could offer your take on some of the following dishes listed:

a) Shakshuka (my top 5 dishes of all time for me, but getting mixed-messages about what style is true to Tunisia vs Moroccan, Turkish, Egyptian, Afghan etc)  
b) Lablabi  
c) Brik a l'oeuf  
d) Slata mechouia  
e) Loubia  
f) Shorba Frik

These are just examples. If the community here has other dishes and personal Tunisian homemade favorite recipes, I'd be keen to learn, or from whom I can find authentic recipes (...and grateful if it's in English).

I really enjoy what I've tried/been given so far. It has a lot of similarities to North-West/Western Indian cuisines that I'm familiar with, including sweet/dessert dishes, and some Italian overlaps too; and happy to exchange recipes as a thank you. For example in Western India a dish very similar to Shakshuka substitutes egg for Potatoes as the base ingredient (Batata Nu Shaak, or, 'potato curry'). Other very similar Tunis \~ Indian equivalents are:  

Zalabiya \~ Jelebi;   
Makroudh \~ Barfi (well, one of the many types);   
Harissa Hlowa \~ Sooji Badam Halwa.   
(They're not exactly the same, but if you compare recipes, you'll find they're almost the same ingredients with some variation on how to cook or style/dress).

","In djerba there are plenty of adresses:

For food:
Top1- El sofra restaurant, behind the primary school of Houmt-Souk. Excellent spot, you would love everything. Even in the rest of Tunisia you won't find the same quality of service or cooking.

2- Haroun restaurant: Near the Marina, not very far from the first one. Chic vibe, order sea fish if there is. If the fish is from a fishfarm probably go for something else.

3-Malibou restaurant in the same are.

4- Chez Ali, retaurant pied dans l'eau (just in front of the sea) only serves midday dishes, only two dishes, fish or schrimp. Very good also, but be sure to go early or have a reservation because it's usually full.

For spots:
There are plentyyy even one week wouldn't be enough:
Gallela
1-Gallela and the pottery shops. People are also sweethearts (like most djerbians).
2- Gallela history museum+
3- Ask pottery artisants to organise with you clay extraction excursion, will take around half a day but it's worth it.

Midoun:
1- Lella hadhreya complex: Crocodile farm+ museum+ traditional house visit
2- Alot of other beaches (Seguiya/ sidi yeti 1/2).
3- Midoun center + the shops (try brick in the shops)

Houmt-Souk:
1- Museum
2- Ghazi Mustafa fort
3- The fish market
4- The old town shops.
5- The jewellery shops.

Somewhere in Sedwikch:
1- Satouri mosque and the legend around it (maybe i have the wrong adress or the mosque name) but ask for the mosque with the hundrer of human statues.


Other than that, try snorkling and some sea activities.

I loved Hammemet, I loved the beautiful land, cuisine and history and I'm looking for a place where I can not just relax, but also walk in the evening, experience the local culture and history and have trips during the day (ex Kairouan, el djem, Sahara).

Tunisia,Tunisian cuisine,Holidays in Yasmin Hammamet in May,"Hello guys,

I decided to post here since it's the best place to ask about Tunisia. We have booked our first international holiday in Hammamet and I'm a preparation freak so I'd want to ask about a few things.

1. How is the public transport working in Hammamet area? Are there any buses or trains so we can travel around the region? Our local govt recommends using SNTRI buses but I cannot find any information nor timetables for these lines. We'd like to travel Yasmin Hammamet -> Hammamet -> Nabeul.   
Alternatively we are considering taking a taxi, but how high are the fares nowadays? How do I catch/order the taxi? Is it possible to communicate with drivers in ENG or rather in French or Arabic?  
Furthermore, does Google Maps work well in Hammamet? Or is it better to stick to local maps and just ask in the hotel for directions?
2. How can we recognise tourist traps? I'd love to try real tunisian cuisine, but I'm afraid that there's gonna be a lot of places catered especially to tourists since we are visiting a resort city.
3. What can you recommend to visit in Hammamet area? I know that there are WWII historical places and that Nabeul is known for ceramics.
4. How safe is Hammamet? Are there any place in particular that we shouldn't visit?
5. I'd be very thankful for any cultural/behavioral advices so we are not ignorant while visiting 🫶

Tunisia,Tunisian cuisine,Looking for tourism tips in Tunisia,"Hello guys,

I will be visiting Tunisia during November for a couple of weeks coming from Northern Europe. Really looking forward! I'm planning to stay in AirBNBs and travel between various cities to see and experience as much as I can. I'm not interested in tourist hotels or restaurants that make European food. I don't want to create an artificial barrier between me and local culture. I want to try Tunisian cuisine, experience local activities, feel the culture. I wanted to ask the community for some tips and tricks - anything that has to do with the late autumn season, tourists from Europe and their safety, must-visit places. My questions are genuine and if they sound harsh - I'm not looking to insult anyone, just to know what should I be worried about and what is fine. I understand every place has its own culture and unwritten rules and I'm looking to learn that.  


\- What cities / particular locations are of interest and must see?  
\- Is the cuisine similar throughout the country or various regions have their top dishes? What are the top dishes to try? (I don't have dietary restrictions)  
\- How's the bus / train infrastructure between the cities? Is there a website to pre-order tickets?  
\- Is it safe for the foreigner to drive around? How's the bribery culture? Should I expect being stopped by the police for the bribes without a reason?  
\- How's the night life? Is it a thing to go to the bars or night clubs during the weekend and what places are recommended to go to?  
\- Any strong DO NOTs? (I.e. never go to the Mosque with shorts, etc.)  
\- Should I be worried about jewellery and travel without it or is it generally safe in the streets?  
\- Maybe you feel there is something I didn't mention, but it is worth considering?  


Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward so much to this trip. :)","I will get back to qsts 1&2 later in the comment.

3/ the bus & train infrastructure in the country is barely average. There is no website you could pre-order tickets. You basically have to arrive at the station to buy ur tickets. The thing that will make you probably not choose trains/buses is confort & time which is the opposite of what you want. It takes you around 3 hours for around 200 km. And yes it is not comfortable in anyway. The best option for you in this case might be driving.. so renting a car. It costs you around 150 TND [our currency] per day. 
4/ It is safe for you to drive around. There is a high chance you would be stopped by the police yes BUT there is no reason for you to worry as long as you have the necessary papers. There are 4 necessary papers, ownership of the car/ insurrance on the car/ Valid driving liscence & ID. Ignore their attempts to take money as a bribe, if they have nothing against you you're safe. Also just a side note, as long as you're a foreigner they are more precautious when dealing with you.
5/ Night life in Tunisia is fine, it actually meets the purpose. I mean if you want smwhere to go out, have a few drinks and enjoy your night. It's really easy. Don't expect anything extra like themed parties, special events or really hardcore all_night parties . Don't also expect to be sweating on the dance floor since the music will probavly send you off (haha) but it's not bad overall. 4 cities are known with decent nightlife culture (Djerba-Hammamet-Sousse & Gammarth in Tunis) 
6/ My answer is there is not a single strong do not. Just stay out of trouble, like physical fighting or any form of violence .  Don't seek attention and it should be enough to keep you safe.
7/ With jewelry you're safe unless it's really late at night and the streets are empty.. Like if there is no one around and you are WALKING down the street with some jewelry and your phone in your hands, it would put you in some risk. My advice for you is keep it simple, nothing extravagant like a huge gold chain on your neck or anything of this sort and it should be good.  

Now going back to the first 2 questions. 
What cities and what to do in them really depend on your taste. There is a bit of everything. There is so much to see in different cities and it's convenient that Tunisia isn't a huge of a country so you could make it to the north/south/ coast during the same vacations. 
Since you're staying during the winter I'd say you visit Tozeur  in the south for the Sahara settings.
For food, try out different things and see what you like. 
I'll let the chance for others to elaborate more on these two subjects.

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,"Tunisia Solo Female Trip Report: Budget, Highlights, Safety, Tips","Hi Tunisia! I (32F) wanted to share my solo trip experience to help future travelers. It's a long one so feel free to skip my post but I know a lot of people come here asking some questions

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,Travel when pregnant,"Hello! I'm traveling to Tunis for the first time in December. I was curious about a few things

- where is the best place to buy baby products? Clothes?

- what foods should I avoid? I've read that I should be careful with fresh vegetables

- does anyone know restaurants that non-smoking? Or have a good separation between smoking and non-smoking sections? I live in Asia and some restaurants don't separate the sections well. I really want to avoid second hand smoke as much as I can since I'm pregnant.

Thanks for any help!","Well, for the fresh vegetables, it depends on your toxoplasmosis results, if you are positive, you are OK, if you are negative, you should not eat fresh vegetables and fruits you did not wash yourself thoroughly (you should know that) this is not only in Tunisia, but every where around the world, even in your country. So I guess you should avoid salads, or ask if it is cooked or not. Also insist that your meals should not be decorated with any kind of fresh herbs and stuff like that. If you have to, have a card with you written in arabic, saying that you can't eat non cooked vegetables and fruits, to show it whenever you need to.

For restaurants, ask to be placed in the non smoking sections, by law, that should be available, but people are sometimes assholes, and will smoke anyways, so be firm about it, and ask those who work there to be careful about it.

For baby products: Are you shopping for your future baby?

For clothes, there are some baby and kid clothing stores, you can spot them in malls. You can also ask around.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/184xlw3/travel_when_pregnant/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,Visiting Tunisia for a week in May. Recommendations (in particular regarding staying in Sousse)?,"Hello everyone,

I'll be visiting Tunisia in May, landing in Enfidha and departing from Tunis after 8 days. I'm mostly interested in visiting the historical and architectural sites, as well as spending some afternoons and evenings relaxing by the beach or at a bar if weather permits. Since a week isn't too much time, I'll be focusing on Tunis/Carthage/Sidi Bou Said around the capital, and the area around Sousse/Monastir/El Jem/Kairouan further south. 

My current plan would be to book an accommodation for 4-5 nights somewhere in Sousse, and 2-3 nights in Tunis. Sousse appeals to me because as far as I can tell it's got nice beaches and good touristic infrastructure, while also being the main transportation hub in the area which would make it easy to do a bunch of short day trips to the other sites by train or louage (I really rather not rent a car). However, I've also read that it can be quite hectic in the touristic season, but I'm hoping things will still be relatively calm in May (would that be the case?) Alternatively, I've read that Monastir and Mahdia in particular are calmer with even better beaches, but of course with the trade-off not not being as well connected as Sousse.

So, does Sousse sound like it would best suit my needs? If so, what particular areas, beaches, or accommodations would you recommend? It doesn't have to be a standard hotel/resort, as a matter of fact I'd be interested in alternative/unique accommodations that you may be familiar with. Ideally tough I'd like to stay within walking distance to a beach and maybe some restaurants/bars.

Thanks for reading!

Tunisia,best restaurants in Tunis,Where to stay in Tunis -- Gammarth vs. La Marsa vs. Sidi Bou Said,"My girlfriend and I will be visiting Tunis and other areas of Northern Tunisia for 2 weeks in August. We are having some trouble deciding where to stay for our portion in (greater) Tunis. Most sources online suggest staying outside of Tunis proper, recommending the northern suburbs instead. Within these northern suburbs, we cannot decide between Gammarth, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. I'm hoping you guys can confirm/deny the impressions I've gathered of each area from my research.

Gammarth seems like it has the best nightlife and underground electronic music (which we are fans of), but most of the hotels and restaurants in the area have bad reviews. Are all of the restaurants in Gammarth bad and catered to tourists? How are the beaches in Gammarth?

Sidi Bou Said looks very beautiful, including the hotels, but it is unclear if there are any bars in the town. Is Sidi Bou Said dry or are there bars/pubs in the area worth going to? 

La Marsa seems to have a good set of restaurants and cocktail bars, and seems relatively walkable (all positives). But, while Gammarth has nightlife and Sidi Bou Said is picturesque, it's unclear if there's anything unique or distinctive about La Marsa. Is this fair?

Tunisia,seafood in Sousse,First impression of Tunisia… from an outsider.,"I’m Indonesian, and I just visited Tunisia at the end of last year (which was one week ago) to visit my boyfriend’s family. Tunisia is very beautiful. The coastline? Breathtaking. The hills around Tunis that you can see from the Highway? Beautiful. The food? Amazing. The seafood? SCRUMPTIOUS. Here are some positive things I really loved:

1. People are extremely friendly:
We went to the market and bought some stuff for New Year’s Eve. At the butcher, the man asked me where I’m from and he said welcome. The fruit-veggie seller said welcome and even wanted to give me the veggies for free (I rejected, of course). The guy at the Bourguiba Museum said welcome and told me that it’s fascinating that Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. People are so friendly!
2. Amazing food scene:
I am Indonesian - I love spicy food! I think I’ve been eating so much. I love the seafood, it’s so fresh and reminds me of home. I love the sweets. The portions are also huge - this part is when my boyfriend steps in and would help finish my food!
3. Great entertainment:
Coffee shops, bars, all these things are important for me. I love how it’s very open. So much music, dancing - or even just to hang out and talk with your friends. It’s very nice to see these places all lively and crowded, especially on weekends.
4. Rich culture and history:
I went to the Museum in Bardo and in Sousse. Both museums are amazing. So much history, and as a history nerd, I was so delighted to see that they are preserved. These are the things that Tunisia, as a country, needs to protect as Tunisia has thousands of years of rich history. The guide we had in Bardo was super nice and gave us a thorough explanation on Tunisian history. 

But, here are some negative things I noticed:
1. Lack of public transportation:
See, as an Indonesian, I can’t really criticize Tunisia on this, but considering the fact that Tunisia is rather small compared to Indonesia, I think the country can do so much better.
I took the SNCFT from Sousse to Tunis. The train arrived (30 mins late), I cannot help but notice that the trains are very similar to what we used to have before a massive transformation around a decade ago.
The Tunis-Carthage airport is also chaotic. I really love the architecture inside, I find it very original, but I find it too chaotic - too many staffs, they change gates without prior notification, etc. 
This lack of public transport is then added up by another issue, which is the fact that cars are heavily taxed. My boyfriend’s mom thought that I am very rich because I have my own car in Indonesia. I am not. When I heard that my tiny, €6.5k car costs almost €8.5k in Tunisia, I was shook. How are people supposed to transport themselves if cars are very expensive but yet public transport is severely lacking?
2. Lack of digitalization:
When I asked my boyfriend if we could buy the train tickets online, he laughed. I also had to stick to cash - I’ve never handled cash, ever. In Indonesia, we pay with bank apps and e-wallet apps by scanning QR Codes. In Tunis, my card got declined 3 times - there was not even a notification that the transaction failed, which means that the card machine didn’t even work.

Negative sides aside, I had an amazing time in Tunisia. Will definitely re-visit sometime in the Summer! 3aychek!","I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip, and we hope you come visit us again.  
Yes, we have been suffering from public transportation for decades, and no one has yet found a solution (this includes the bus, the train, the metro and even Tunisair flights-planes).

However, using cards to pay is not yet a culture here, you can say that all Tunisians must have cash to shop comfortably, but we are getting better day by day (but slowly), we mostly use cards to extract cash from ATM.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1913psr/first_impression_of_tunisia_from_an_outsider/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage",General,en

Tunisia,Tunisian desserts,"Tunisian ""Original"" Recipes","Asleema all,

I've been trying to develop my Tunisian cooking range, and the more I look into it, the more I find there are many differing suggestions on what is a true/typical Tunisian recipe vs what has been changed or modified. As such I was wondering if people in this community knew or could offer your take on some of the following dishes listed:

a) Shakshuka (my top 5 dishes of all time for me, but getting mixed-messages about what style is true to Tunisia vs Moroccan, Turkish, Egyptian, Afghan etc)  
b) Lablabi  
c) Brik a l'oeuf  
d) Slata mechouia  
e) Loubia  
f) Shorba Frik

These are just examples. If the community here has other dishes and personal Tunisian homemade favorite recipes, I'd be keen to learn, or from whom I can find authentic recipes (...and grateful if it's in English).

I really enjoy what I've tried/been given so far. It has a lot of similarities to North-West/Western Indian cuisines that I'm familiar with, including sweet/dessert dishes, and some Italian overlaps too; and happy to exchange recipes as a thank you. For example in Western India a dish very similar to Shakshuka substitutes egg for Potatoes as the base ingredient (Batata Nu Shaak, or, 'potato curry'). Other very similar Tunis \~ Indian equivalents are:  

Zalabiya \~ Jelebi;   
Makroudh \~ Barfi (well, one of the many types);   
Harissa Hlowa \~ Sooji Badam Halwa.   
(They're not exactly the same, but if you compare recipes, you'll find they're almost the same ingredients with some variation on how to cook or style/dress).

Tunisia,hiking in Tunisia,where to go on a hike in tunisia?,"Hi, i want to go on a hike something accessible and close to tunis and most importantly safe .

if any of you guys know a trusted group on facebook or club please let me know 

thank you in advance .","Search for rondonne djbel rsas

There's almost weekly hikes scheduled there, its a medium/high difficulty hike but definitely worth it + there's guides and safety experts in these planned hikes they cost 60/80tnd a day.

It is a bit expensive it's not that hard to go without a guide as long as you're a bit athletic I'd recommend having at least 1 person with you you never know what happens.

I hiked it a total of 5 times without any accident, and started taking beginner level friends there, as long as you're careful you're okay.

It's a 45 min drive from centre ville tunis, there's a place to park your car and it's safe from people and animals.

You can take ""na9l jame3i"" from ""chera3 carthage"" to ""mornag"" and from mornag take ""na9l rifi"" to "" al birou"" 

If you're going with car ask for ""al birou"" don't follow google maps there it's messed up and it'll take you to deadends.

Just ask people it's not that confusing.

Tunisia,hiking in Tunisia,We hiked along the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia and found some amazing WWII installations.,,"The Mareth Line was a system of fortifications built by France in southern Tunisia in the late 1930s. The line was intended to protect Tunisia against an Italian invasion from its colony in Libya. It ended up being occupied by Axis forces during World War II and was the site of a key battle during the Allied invasion of North Africa in March 1943. There's a serious landmine issue in this part of Tunisia, so we had to do a lot of research before wandering off the beaten track! DO NOT attempt to replicate this trek without seeking expert advice.  
We started up in Toujane at the anti-aircraft installations on Kef Enssoura and made our way down to Mareth itself. We ended up in Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's command bunker, complete with incredibly preserved frescoes from the 1940s. Great to finally find the well-hidden HQ of The Desert Fox!

Tunisia,hiking in Tunisia,"Coming to spend half a year in Tunisia, need your help","Hi reddit and its Tunisians!
I'm planning to come live there in Autumn for half a year or so and I immensely need your advice on a list of aspects. Huge thanks in advance.

1. Is €1000-1500 a month enough to live there including rent in a decent safe neighborhood close to the shoreline? I work online, don't need a job. I've checked numbeo.com and all of the such, but numbers still differ on different sources. My needs are: 1-2 time a week eat-out (nowhere too fancy tho); 2-bedroom (or spacious 1-bedroom) flat in a nice hood; occasional sightseeing tours etc; good unlimited internet both at home and mobile; fine products to cook at home; maybe a couple of low-cost city breaks in Paris and other nearest cheap-to-reach European cities.
2. Which city would you recommend for that? Non-conservative, not too noisy and hustling, but with some fun places to go from time to time to meet local and foreing people and do something.
3. Is Tunisian youth open to foreigners and communication? How close is the community?
4. The eternal safety question. Pov: I'm a 26 yo pale-white long-haired bloke with a couple piercings, tattoos and the such, quite informal I would say. How much attention and eyes am I about to catch? 😁 Like is it fine walking at night without worrying too much? (Assuming I live in a good area)
4.1. I may also come with my girlfriend, same questions about her + are we okay living together while not being married?
5. I see quite different rent prices on eg. reddit and mubawab, what should I expect with requirements in question 1? Fully-furnished ofc. 
6. How good is the situation with internet and mobile network? I need a very stable communication because I use video calls all the time for work. Is it possible to get a plan with unlimited data? How much is it gonna cost me? Both home and mobile, please.
7. How safe is the country in the rural areas? Like if we talk about hiking, visiting the villages, the Sahara tours and so on
8. How bad is it with the traffic and driving style and how insensible is it of me to hire a motorbike?
9. How serious is the situation with the revolution, unrests and political instability? Are the police dangerous to interact with? Is there anything like authoritarian regime or so? Maybe any topics to avoid bringing up when talking to locals?
10. Any national hobbies/interests/cultural aspects to dive in or be ready for beforehand? Like what Tunisians love and admire etc.
11. I know English is not popular there, but I can speak a little French. Is enhancing the latter enough or learning key Arabic is my only way?

Huge thanks for answering, you'll help me a ton! Any other thoughts and details are very welcome 🙃","you have too many questions im answering the first one

Tunisia,hiking in Tunisia,Visiting this December. What do you think of this itinerary?,"Hi everyone,

I will be visiting Tunisia for 10 days this December and the below is my itinerary. After extensive research I came to the conclusion that I will be using mostly '*louages*' to travel between a place and another. I travelled to North African countries in the past and I also know that life is usually slow paced so I'm not hassling much regarding accommodation as will be traveling during a relatively low season period. I consider myself as a slow traveller as well so won't be rushing (*as long as I'm not late for my flight lol*)

I will be landing early afternoon in Tunis airport and the plan is to get downtown, get a 'louage' and start making my way south-bound. My plan is to arrive somewhere close to Douz and explore the area of Qibili, Chott el Djerid and Tozeur. Probably I would be required to change louage at Kairouan were I wouldn't mind staying an overnight there.

When I eventually arrive at Douz area, I will dedicate 3 days to explore the area and then head north directly to Tunis were I will be spending my last 3 days there to visit Sidi Bou Said, Tunis Medina and Roman/Byzantine archaeological sites. Not interested in going to Tattoonie area and Star Wars sets. Don't think it's worth the time.

Dunno if someone can answer this but what route should I take with the louages to arrive in Douz area? Does Tunis - Kairouan - Douz make sense or I'm missing something? I'm interested in outdoor, hiking, desert, food, culture. Not interested in congested cities and luxury resorts.

Any tips are highly appreciated. Can't wait to visit the country!

Tunisia,hiking in Tunisia,The collapse is impending it's just matter of time ,"People ask me why you're so pessimist just have faith but I think the fact says otherwise. 

The collapse is approaching and omlne of the reason is demography, Tunisia is the last fertile country in the developing world there are less new born every year and this due to the economic crisis that hit the population since 2010 and due to the fact that most people are leaving the country en masse especially highly skilled and educated people. 

Politically there are no vision for the future and the economic outlook is kinda dark the country is unable to attract investors in fields with high added values we only relies on textiles and tourism in country that is suffering from water scarcity.
In the same order of ideas the country is investing millions in building desalination station in country suffering that import energy from the global market instead of repairing the infrastructure which can bring the same amount of water we trying to pump from desalination station at lesser cost. 1m3 of dessalinated water cost almost 9DInars the state is going to sell it at 0.5 Dinars. Good business!! 

So lately buying coffee is considered a luxury and the state is publicly announcing the purchase few tons of coffee like it's a big achievement. All while hiking the prices of everything. I'm amazed that average Chinese phones cost over 1000dinars. 

Another thing that we should talk about is staggering number of illegal sub saharien immigrants present across the country. We share absolutely zero responsibility in the suffering of these people but we're playing europe guard dog now holding thousands of people with no education and income in the country and hoping that the problem will solve it self but in return it created more problems from human trafficking to small town and agricultural lands are turned into tents cities.

My needs are: 1-2 time a week eat-out (nowhere too fancy tho); 2-bedroom (or spacious 1-bedroom) flat in a nice hood; occasional sightseeing tours etc; good unlimited internet both at home and mobile; fine products to cook at home; maybe a couple of low-cost city breaks in Paris and other nearest cheap-to-reach European cities.
2. Which city would you recommend for that? Non-conservative, not too noisy and hustling, but with some fun places to go from time to time to meet local and foreing people and do something.
3. Is Tunisian youth open to foreigners and communication? How close is the community?
4. The eternal safety question. Pov: I'm a 26 yo pale-white long-haired bloke with a couple piercings, tattoos and the such, quite informal I would say. How much attention and eyes am I about to catch? 😁 Like is it fine walking at night without worrying too much? (Assuming I live in a good area)
4.1. I may also come with my girlfriend, same questions about her + are we okay living together while not being married?
5. I see quite different rent prices on eg. reddit and mubawab, what should I expect with requirements in question 1? Fully-furnished ofc. 
6. How good is the situation with internet and mobile network? I need a very stable communication because I use video calls all the time for work. Is it possible to get a plan with unlimited data? How much is it gonna cost me? Both home and mobile, please.
7. How safe is the country in the rural areas? Like if we talk about hiking, visiting the villages, the Sahara tours and so on
8. How bad is it with the traffic and driving style and how insensible is it of me to hire a motorbike?
9. How serious is the situation with the revolution, unrests and political instability? Are the police dangerous to interact with? Is there anything like authoritarian regime or so? Maybe any topics to avoid bringing up when talking to locals?
10. Any national hobbies/interests/cultural aspects to dive in or be ready for beforehand? Like what Tunisians love and admire etc.
11. I know English is not popular there, but I can speak a little French. Is enhancing the latter enough or learning key Arabic is my only way?

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,Sahara tours,Tunisians! I need travel tips,"Hey folks - in just a few weeks I'll be flying from Toronto to Tunis, renting a car and driving to Sousse to stay for 2 weeks. I'm hoping some of the Tunisian Redditors can help out a Canadian visitor with travel tips.

1 - I have read that driving in Tunisia is not for the faint of heart. On a scale of 1-10 how likely am I to get in a crash between teh airport and Sousse? How likely am I to get lost?

2 - Are the paid tours worth paying for, or should we DIY an itinerary? I'm travelling with my daughter (26) and her boyfriend (27) my wife and I (mid 50's). Looking at the 3-4 day itineraries to go to Sidi Bou Said, The amphitheater (El Jeb? El Jem? I forget), Tatooine, the Sahara, etc. it seems like everything could be put together without a guide. Do you need a guide to get in these places? Am I crazy to go on our own? And once again, will I get in a wreck if I do all this driving? (We see a lot of tourists paying for guides in Canada, when they could literally walk in the places on their own, and it baffles us.)

3 - I've read that the medina/souk scene is full of aggressive people trying to force you into bad deals. Last time I shopped in a souk was in Rabat in the early 2000's (I loved it!). Should we be concerned with folks being overly aggressive? Are panhandlers a problem? How about thieves/pickpockets? (In Rabat a guy followed us around the whole time chanting anti-American slogans which was great since we are Canadian. It was pretty funny.)

4 - We all speak English and some French. I think we'll be fine language-wise, although, as with Morocco, I suspect folks will speak Arabic around us, and French/English to us. Should we be concerned with language being a problem?

Any other tips you'd share with friends coming to visit? Anything we should make sure to do while there? Anything that is clearly over-rated and we should maybe not bother with?

Tunisia,Sahara tours,Tunisia in April Trip review,"Hi Folks,

I am planning on traveling in Tunisia for about 3 weeks but week 1 I will be working in the evenings so really two weeks full off. Here is my tentative plan. I think the way I have, is too biased towards the coastal cities, am I missing out on some other places? Please let me know your thoughts.

&#x200B;

April 15th - 18th - Tunis (Work in the evenings)

18th - 20th - Sidi Bou Said (Work in the evenings)

20th - Douz

21st-23rd Sahara camping tour (Vacation begins)

23rd (may extend to do some other adventure in Sahara like Quad bike)

24th explore star wars hotel and chott el djerid, evening in Djerba

25th Stay in Djerba

26th - One night in Sfax

27th - Drive to El Jem, spend a day (Night in Monastir/Soussee)

28th and 29th evening in Soussee

30th and 1st - Kairoukuan (visit Chebika oasis, Mosque, etc.)

2nd - Stay in Hammamet

3rd - 6th - Any suggestions? Maybe head back to Tunis and explore Cape Angela?

Also, 15-21 is overlapping with Ramadan time. Would finding places to eat and all be a bit difficult?  Initially, I was thinking of renting a car from Djerba but it seems like going from Tunis to Douz is not straightforward. Is that the case? Would I need a 4\*4 car or would a normal  compact car would do?

Tunisia,Sahara tours,Visiting Tunisia for the first time! Hoping for travel recommendations.,"Hi r/Tunisia. Hope you're all finding balance and strength throughout the pandemic.

My fiancé and I are traveling to Tunisia from Montréal later this month. Our itinerary has us in Tunis for a few days, then Djerba, then a Sahara tour, and then back in Tunis to close it all out. We'll be in the country for ten days total. 

I've got a couple specific (maybe weird?) questions that I'm hoping you could answer. Any tips would be massively appreciated.

1) Places to see live music in Tunis. In particular, I'm a huge fan of Anouar Brahem, the Tunisian oud player, so traditional music would be amazing. But any music really (assuming the pandemic hasn't shut all that down).

2) Seafood restaurants in Tunis or Djerba. Not looking for anything fancy, but ideally somewhere that serves octopus. Love octopus.

3) Somewhere where I can buy or develop 35mm film. I'll be taking photos during the trip and would prefer to have them developed in Tunis rather than risk the negatives being scanned at the airport. Somewhere that sells old vintage cameras would be a bonus!

4) Places to buy vinyl records?

5) Tips on getting a PCR test done in Tunis. I tried using the booking website but it seems like we need to either call or visit in person, rather than book online. If anyone can point us to the a reliable testing centre in Tunis it'd be super helpful.

4) And just food recommendations in general, or places in Tunis and Djerba that you think fly under the radar. Or general travel tips/precautions that we should know.

Thanks so much!",[removed],20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/snu02n/visiting_tunisia_for_the_first_time_hoping_for/,"Tunis, Djerba, Tunis",Recommendation,en

Tunisia,water sports,Things I Learned the Hard Way Before Turning 25,"**Things I Learned the Hard Way Before Turning 25**

1. **Growing Up Without a Father or Female Figure** If you grow up in an environment without a father or female figure, that's okay. When you're older, seek someone you admire and aspire to be like. Follow their advice and guidance to become a better version of yourself. Learn from the lessons you discovered late, and make it a priority to teach these to your own children one day.
2. **Emptiness Is Your Worst Enemy** An idle mind can lead you down destructive paths. Fill your time with something meaningful—join a club, play a sport, work, or dive into hobbies. Staying productive helps you avoid falling into the traps of laziness and procrastination, which can cling to you like a bad habit.
3. **Feeling Confused Is Normal** It's okay to feel lost and unsure about your future, especially when you're young. In fact, the sooner you recognize this confusion, the better—it means you're aware of a problem and ready to start solving it. Awareness is always the first step. Choose a direction, take action, and keep at it. Even if it's not perfect, at least you're spending your time building something rather than wasting it on meaningless distractions.
4. **Surround Yourself with Better People** The people you keep close have a huge influence on your mindset, behavior, and actions. If you're surrounded by unmotivated or negative people, don’t be surprised if their energy rubs off on you. Seek out friends who uplift and inspire you, and avoid those who bring you down.
5. **Listen to Constructive Criticism** If multiple people from different environments point out the same flaw in you, it’s worth reflecting on. Work on yourself to become a better version. Don't stubbornly ""be yourself"" if that version is toxic or unproductive. Learn how to communicate effectively, when to stay silent, and how to test the waters before being fully open in different environments. Keep personal matters private unless necessary—professional settings, family gatherings, and social circles all require different levels of sharing.

Tunisia,diving in Tunisia,"Gambling, Not Investing: The Reality of Trading Crypto","Hey everyone,

Lately, I’ve been noticing a growing number of people wanting to get into trading, especially in cryptocurrencies. On top of that, more and more online trading courses are popping up, promising to teach you how to **""live off trading.""**

Let me introduce myself: **I'm Selim,** finance student in Canada, currently finishing my diploma and starting my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) certification. One of my dreams is to create a portfolio management fund, so I know a thing or two about this topic (though I’m not claiming to be a genius).

I’ve been interested in cryptocurrencies for over 5 years and have seen just about everything—bull runs, bear markets, copy-trading, and even **people faking demo portfolios on platforms like CoinMarketCap to fool others**. Honestly, it makes me laugh to see how far some will go to take advantage of people’s lack of knowledge, and the worst part? **People actually believe them.**

Today, I’m here to explain **why 99.9% of the people who claim to be profitable in crypto, or even make enough money to live from trading, are lying or, at best, exceptions to the rule.** I also want to break down why, for most people, **crypto-trading isn’t much different from gambling.**

**What is trading? A quick history lesson**

Before diving deeper, let’s take a moment to understand what trading really is.

Trading dates back centuries, and one of the earliest examples involves **merchant ships and shared investments**. At the time, trading wasn’t about buying and selling stocks or currencies—it was a practical way to share risk.

Here’s how it worked:

* A group of investors would put their money  together to buy a ship.
* The ship would embark on a journey, often lasting months, to sell goods in distant markets.
* When the ship returned, the investors would sell the remaining goods and even the ship itself, splitting the profits.

This is the foundation of trading: **taking calculated risks with the hope of earning returns.** But back then, trading was based on tangible goods and real economic activity—not speculative price movements.

Today, however, most “trading” has little to do with creating value or sharing risks. In crypto markets, it’s often closer to gambling, as I’ll explain below.

# 1. Trading is closer to gambling than investing

First off, let’s make one thing clear: **trading is not investing.** When you trade, you’re not creating any value. You’re simply betting on price fluctuations. These fluctuations often **follow a random pattern**—what mathematicians call a **Brownian motion**.

Here’s the problem:

* Imagine flipping a coin. You have a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing.
* With trading fees, your odds are even worse—your chances of winning drop below 50%.

In other words, **over time, the average trader will lose money** because the odds are stacked against them.

# 2. The odds of consistent profits are stacked against you

Trading is a **zero-sum game**: for every winner, there’s an equivalent loser. And when you add fees from platforms like Binance or Coinbase, it becomes a **negative-sum game.**

Here’s a simple equation:

>**E\[R\]=G−F**

E\[R\] = expected return  
G = gross gain potential  
F = fees and costs

Even if you’re good at trading, fees chip away at your profits. Over time, **your average return becomes negative.**

# 3. Randomness drives most “success stories”

A lot of people who claim they’re making big money in crypto trading are either lying or mistaking luck for skill.

* **The law of large numbers**: If 10,000 people trade crypto, it’s inevitable that a handful will make huge gains purely by chance. These people then brag about their “success,” but they’re the exception, not the rule.
* **Survivorship bias**: You only hear about the winners, not the thousands of people who’ve lost their shirts.

# 4. It’s not as simple as a few charts and some gut feelings

***I’ve even seen someone open a trading training center, claiming to teach others how to “succeed” in crypto***. But let me be honest: **as someone studying finance, trading successfully is far from simple.**

To truly become a professional trader, you need:

* A deep understanding of **mathematics**,
* Knowledge of **predictive models**,
* Expertise in **quantitative finance** (and that’s just the beginning).

You’re not just up against other individual traders. You’re competing with:

* **High-frequency trading algorithms,**
* **Quant teams at banks and hedge funds,**
* **Institutions with access to data and technology you can’t even dream of.**

Believing you can beat them by looking at a couple of charts and making a few guesses is, quite frankly, naïve. **Yes, it’s possible to make money occasionally**, especially if you’re well-informed on a few specific cryptos. But let’s be real: it’s no different from hitting a lucky streak at the casino.

# 5. Our lack of financial education is part of the problem

**I’m not here to hate on anyone or crush anyone’s dreams**. I just want to open people’s eyes. It’s sad to see so many people get caught up in false promises and waste their money because of **a lack of financial education.**

If our countries placed more emphasis on teaching financial literacy, people wouldn’t fall for these scams or illusions of easy money. They’d understand that **real wealth is built through reasonable, long-term investments not gambling on short-term price swings.**

# Final thoughts

I understand the excitement around crypto—it’s a fascinating space. But if you’re serious about building wealth, focus on:

* Diversifying your portfolio,
* Investing regularly (for exemple every month you can save 20% of your salary to invest it)
* And avoiding the traps of short-term speculation.

And please, ask yourself this:  
**If these so-called trading “experts” were really making so much money, why are they wasting their time selling you courses for 200dt?**

Take care of your money, and remember: financial freedom isn’t built overnight, and it’s certainly not built on luck.

Tunisia,diving in Tunisia,I am planning a trip to Tunisia and need some help about it :),"Hello! 
I am planning a trip to a beautiful country Tunisia this September for a week, will be going by a taxi from Algeria. I am thinking about visiting 2-3 cities, Tabarka, Tunis and maybe something else, but I am not sure yet. So, my questions are:

1) What are the best snorkeling spots in Tunisia? Considering the fact that I’ll be heading from Algeria, it would be the best if maybe some of the spots will be nearby from it. 
2) Also would like to know about scuba diving spots. Heard that there is a good one in Tabarka, but not sure about that. 
3) Is there a good beaches in Tabarka?
4) I want to go from Tabarka to Tunis by a bus (or a train), is this possible, how can I do that and how much will the ticket cost? 
5) Also in my journey between Tabarka and Tunis I would love to visit cap Angela. How can I do that? Is there a bus between this 2 destinations? 

Thank you for all your help and information! Have a good day!","2. I am a scuba diving instructor and in my opinion, the best scuba diving in Tunisia is in Tabarka. You can go to the port and look at the signs for which company to go with, or find one on Facebook.

4. You can take a louage (like a mini bus) between the two— I dont know exactly how much it costs but maybe between 20 and 30 dinar? Someone else might have a better idea.

Issued in French under the title Gérer la crise en temps d’incertitudes (Managing the crisis in times of uncertainty), the report forecasts economic growth of 2.7%  in 2022, largely due to the post-COVID recovery of tourism and trade, plus the solid performance of the mining and light manufacturing sectors. This growth rate is slightly lower than earlier World Bank forecasts, a reflection of the impact of the war in Ukraine. As a result, the economy is expected in 2022 to remain well below the pre-pandemic period. 

“Just as its economy started to recover from the COVID-19 crisis, Tunisia faced the double challenge of rising commodity prices and the war in Ukraine, which has put huge pressure on global wheat and energy supplies.” said Alexandre Arrobbio, World Bank Country Manager for Tunisia. “Cognizant of these unprecedented challenges, at the end of June, the World Bank granted a $130 million loan to Tunisia to help mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine on food security. This will allow the government to finance grain purchases while initiating announced reforms,” added Arrobbio.

The first chapter of the report highlights how the war in Ukraine and rising global commodity and manufacturing prices exacerbated existing vulnerabilities of the Tunisian economy in the first months of 2022. Inflation rose from 6.7% in January 2022 to 8.1% in June 2022, prompting the Central Bank to raise its policy rate, the first increase since 2020. The trade deficit widened by 56% in the first semester of 2022, reaching 8.1% of GDP; and the budget deficit – pushed by mounting energy and food subsidies – is forecast to reach 9.1% in 2022, compared to 7.4% in 2021. 

The second chapter covers the food subsidy system - one of the key drivers of rising trade and budget deficits. In the case of wheat, the report shows that while this subsidy system kept prices stable for consumers, it put significant pressure on the state’s finances, penalized farmers and food processors, and generated over-consumption, with significant leakages and waste. The report stresses that replacing subsidized food prices with compensatory cash transfers to vulnerable households would make the system more efficient, reduce fiscal and import costs, and strengthen food security in the face of future shocks.",No top comment,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/y2h85h/the_slow_economic_recovery_from_covid19_and_a/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,safety tips for Tunisia,Looking for tourism tips in Tunisia,"Hello guys,

I will be visiting Tunisia during November for a couple of weeks coming from Northern Europe. Really looking forward! I'm planning to stay in AirBNBs and travel between various cities to see and experience as much as I can. I'm not interested in tourist hotels or restaurants that make European food. I don't want to create an artificial barrier between me and local culture. I want to try Tunisian cuisine, experience local activities, feel the culture. I wanted to ask the community for some tips and tricks - anything that has to do with the late autumn season, tourists from Europe and their safety, must-visit places. My questions are genuine and if they sound harsh - I'm not looking to insult anyone, just to know what should I be worried about and what is fine. I understand every place has its own culture and unwritten rules and I'm looking to learn that.  


\- What cities / particular locations are of interest and must see?  
\- Is the cuisine similar throughout the country or various regions have their top dishes? What are the top dishes to try? (I don't have dietary restrictions)  
\- How's the bus / train infrastructure between the cities? Is there a website to pre-order tickets?  
\- Is it safe for the foreigner to drive around? How's the bribery culture? Should I expect being stopped by the police for the bribes without a reason?  
\- How's the night life? Is it a thing to go to the bars or night clubs during the weekend and what places are recommended to go to?  
\- Any strong DO NOTs? (I.e. never go to the Mosque with shorts, etc.)  
\- Should I be worried about jewellery and travel without it or is it generally safe in the streets?  
\- Maybe you feel there is something I didn't mention, but it is worth considering?  


Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward so much to this trip. :)","I will get back to qsts 1&2 later in the comment.

3/ the bus & train infrastructure in the country is barely average. There is no website you could pre-order tickets. You basically have to arrive at the station to buy ur tickets. The thing that will make you probably not choose trains/buses is confort & time which is the opposite of what you want. It takes you around 3 hours for around 200 km. And yes it is not comfortable in anyway. The best option for you in this case might be driving.. so renting a car. It costs you around 150 TND [our currency] per day. 
4/ It is safe for you to drive around. There is a high chance you would be stopped by the police yes BUT there is no reason for you to worry as long as you have the necessary papers. There are 4 necessary papers, ownership of the car/ insurrance on the car/ Valid driving liscence & ID. Ignore their attempts to take money as a bribe, if they have nothing against you you're safe. Also just a side note, as long as you're a foreigner they are more precautious when dealing with you.
5/ Night life in Tunisia is fine, it actually meets the purpose. I mean if you want smwhere to go out, have a few drinks and enjoy your night. It's really easy. Don't expect anything extra like themed parties, special events or really hardcore all_night parties . Don't also expect to be sweating on the dance floor since the music will probavly send you off (haha) but it's not bad overall. 4 cities are known with decent nightlife culture (Djerba-Hammamet-Sousse & Gammarth in Tunis) 
6/ My answer is there is not a single strong do not. Just stay out of trouble, like physical fighting or any form of violence .  Don't seek attention and it should be enough to keep you safe.
7/ With jewelry you're safe unless it's really late at night and the streets are empty.. Like if there is no one around and you are WALKING down the street with some jewelry and your phone in your hands, it would put you in some risk. My advice for you is keep it simple, nothing extravagant like a huge gold chain on your neck or anything of this sort and it should be good.  

Now going back to the first 2 questions. 
What cities and what to do in them really depend on your taste. There is a bit of everything. There is so much to see in different cities and it's convenient that Tunisia isn't a huge of a country so you could make it to the north/south/ coast during the same vacations. 
Since you're staying during the winter I'd say you visit Tozeur  in the south for the Sahara settings.
For food, try out different things and see what you like. 
I'll let the chance for others to elaborate more on these two subjects.

Tunisia,safety tips for Tunisia,First time visiting Tunisia tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice?,"So tomorrow I’ll be travelling to Tunisia for the first time from Ireland. I have wanted to visit for a few years now but here I am. I’m staying in Hammamet on a beach hotel. Is there anything to be aware of in terms of scams and safety regarding food etc? 

In terms of money, the Tunisian Dinar is a closed currency so is it best to get some at the airport when I arrive along with a SIM card? I have also been made aware of beach vendors trying to sell you stuff on the beach. Is there any way to avoid this/make them ignore you? Is it similar to Egypt/Türkiye in terms of pushy vendors where they just leave you alone if you ignore/don’t acknowledge them?

","When shopping for souvenirs from souvenir shops without listed prices, I recommend ‘just looking’ first.

Tunisia,safety tips for Tunisia,Solo female travel to Tunisia,"I am seriously considering traveling to Tunisia for 3 to 4 weeks starting in about a month, so late November in to December. I'm just not having a good go at getting recent first hand accounts on what the experience would be like as a solo female western traveler (I'm from the US). I only speak English and very, very basic French. Currently no travel experience in Northern Africa, but I will have been to Egypt right before this. As far as other experience in Muslim and/or Arab countries/areas I have spent a month in Turkey and time in Palestine.

If anyone has any insight as well as links for resources for reading, or recommendations/advice, I would be quite grateful. Mainly trying to get a feel for safety/comfort factor as well as ease of transportation around the country. If anyone has an tips on places to go or avoid that would be great too. I know the basics from what I have been able to read at this point, but alot of the first hand reports I have read are quite dated and speak to alot of hassling and not feeling safe alone. Also, if you have a recommendation for best SIM card to get which would have the most reliable/fast coverage.

Thanks!

Edit to add question about internet.","A couple of thing.  I'm not sure if you're from the US but if you are, make sure you enroll in the STEP program we have here.

I'm an American (Guy) here in Tunisia but this is something that should be a requirement, honestly.  This lets the Embassy know of your general whereabouts while here.  If you're from elsewhere, check out your Embassy if they have a registration program as well.

Generally, females are safe here.  I would say that you need to make sure that you use best practices.  This is a modest/Muslim country so I'd recommend not wearing anything too risque or would attract attention.  You probably won't be targeted more for your being female but more so that you're a tourist so, make sure you're on guard when out and about, just as you would anywhere else.

I've lived in Tunisia for 4 years and I've never had an issue.  My wifes sister had her phone snatched from Her but that's all I know of any sort of crime personally.  I have a co-worker who said people stole his bike but he was out late at night in a neighborhood he shouldn't have been in.  Again, use safe practices while out.

If you would like a local contact, I can be one.  They're good to have.  My wife is Tunisia and speaks English really well.  We both work at the US Embassy here so, we could try to help as best as we could.

As far as best SIM card, I've had Orange for a while now and I like them.  Wife uses Orange too.  TunisiaTelecom I would avoid like the plague.  Ooredoo I'm not a huge fan of but that's just customer service side that I had issues with them.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9ric3v/solo_female_travel_to_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,it
Tunisia,safety tips for Tunisia,"Advice please in regards to which city to choose for a month between Tunis, Monastir, Sousse and Sfax","Hey everyone, this summer in July I am supposed to go on a 1 month medical exchange to Tunisia, and I have to choose a city between Tunis, Monastir, Sousse and Sfax to do my exchange in a hospital. I would love any pointers or advice from you all.  


\> I only speak English, can read Arabic but not speak it well at all, nor French. Is that a problem for any of the cities? Or which one of them will only English be more than helpful in?

\> Does the quality of hospitals differ between the cities? Might be a weird question so sorry about that, but like in my own country the major cities generally tend to have a better hospital and facilities in general.

\> Which city overall would you recommend as the best for a student staying for a month? In terms of safety, friendliness, enjoyment etc  


\> Interested in any general advice for the visit as well! Any tips, must-do's, things to remember etc :)

Thanks for taking out time to answer, very excited to see the lovely country this summer!","Tunis as a city would be better, the cultural scene is richer and there are more trendy events and locations... 
Sousse and Monastir (similar and 20min away from eachother) are better to go to the beach and chill. 
The hospitals in Tunis are better equipped but can be very crowded and chaotic. 
depends wich Hospital tho. 
Under no circumstances go to sfax, it‘s an industrial city and theres absolutely no fun there. 
The private sector is slowly eating the public health sector in Tunisia, our hospitals were once our pride. But they are too old now and not well managed.

Tunisia,safety tips for Tunisia,Questions about living in your country ahead of my 3 month visit,"Hi /r/Tunisia! I will be staying in Tunis for the next three months for a summer job and I am incredibly excited. However, this will be my first time in your beautiful country or even in Africa, which is why I have some questions ahead of my visit that I would appreciate answers to :) 

1. What is the level of English proficiency amongst Tunisians (especially in Tunis)? I know that Arabic and French are the two main languages whilst English is less commonly know, but as someone with no Arabic knowledge and very basic French proficiency, will I be able to survive just on speaking English around the capital or should I revise some basic French phrases?
 
2. Phone Sim Card: Any suggestions as to which provider I should go with, what plan is the best value for money? I definitely need 3G internet access always, so I need a plan with lots or even unlimited data as well as good reliable coverage. 

3. Safety concerns: I've been reassured several times by my employers that the country and city is safe to visit, but I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you have tips about things that I shouldn't do, places I shouldn't visit etc.?

4. The summer heat: how do you guys stay cool? I see that the temperatures can reach above 40 degree celsius, and as someone who has lived in western Europe most of my life, that is really making nervous that I won't be able to stand the heat. Are most buildings air conditioned? Any tips about how to sleep at night, (which I am most worried about)?
5. This might be a somewhat weird question, but what do Tunisians think of Chinese people (I am Chinese). Do people in the capital see many Chinese people (i'm thinking tourists). Will I get looks and stares around the city if I just go on a jog or a walk alone? 

Thank you for reading this long post! Any advice/tips/suggestions that are not related to the questions above would also be appreciated (must-dos, places to eat, things to try etc) :) ","I'll try to answer some of your questions
**1.** I suggest sharpening your French, Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) won't really do much for you anyways
**3.** The more poor a place looks the more reason you should stay away
**4.** At night it gets cooler not chilly but cool enough to let you sleep at night it might get getting used to you'll manage

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,A Concerned Algerian's Perspective on Algerians Visiting Tunisia,"Hey guys,

As an Algerian, I wanted to address something that’s been bothering me for a while. And after an interaction that i had here yesterday, i decided it was time to speak up. I’ve noticed that a lot of Algerians who visit Tunisia don’t always represent us in the best light. It’s frustrating because I know this creates a bad image and reputation for all of us, even though not everyone behaves this way.

The sad reality is that many of the Algerians who head over to Tunisia are not the best reflection of our society. A big reason for this is that hotels in Tunisia are cheaper than those in Algeria, where tourism isn’t as developed. This attracts a certain crowd, often the “scum” of our society, who think that just because they’re in another country, it’s okay to act recklessly.

There’s this mentality among some of them that ""whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" and they believe that drinking, partying excessively, and behaving badly is suddenly acceptable because they’re away from home. But in doing so, they’re not just embarrassing themselves, they’re dragging the reputation of all Algerians through the mud. Not every Algerian fails to make the difference between a Tunisian woman and a prostitute, And not every Algerian fights, yells, and acts dumb over nothing.

To my Tunisians, I want to say that not all Algerians are like this. Many of us value our reputation and respect your country, people, and traditions. I apologize for the actions of those who don’t. It’s unfortunate that this is the image you get of us, if the all the Algerians who visit your country are the good kind, things would have been much better.

To fellow Algerians reading this: Let’s be more mindful of how we represent ourselves when we travel. Our actions abroad reflect not just on us as individuals, but on our entire nation. I visited Tunisia this year and i got treated poorly before they got to know me on a deeper level just because i was Algerian. It's time to stop this madness.

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can open up a constructive discussion about this.","Buddy, all people are welcome here as long as they respect the place and its people, Algerian families/individuals who are just here to have a great time and enjoy their vacation are more than welcome.",76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1f0vs0u/a_concerned_algerians_perspective_on_algerians/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

'O defenders of the homeland!  
Rally around to the glory of our time!  
The blood surges in our veins,  
We die for the sake of our land.'

**WE are the defenders of the homeland. not just the army.**

'No place for betrayers in Tunisia,

even if our own goverment is betraying Tunisia, we shouldn't.

it really doesn't matter if you've never stepped foot out of Tunisia, if u only visit Tunisia during breaks, or if you've never stepped foot in it.

*if the blood that surges in ur veins is tunisian, it should be boiling.*

it should be boiling because ur country is going downhill, it should be boiling because ur president is a traitor, it should be boiling because ur goverment betrayed u, it should be boiling because u- ***WE deserve better.***

**TUNISIA,** the land of sun-drenched shores and ancient whispers, the land that magically weaved together a magical tapestry of Amazigh, Arab, Mediterranean, and African influences, the land of bright faces and enchanting smiles, the land where the most elegant dialect is spoken, the land of beauty, beauty in it's archetecture and natural sites, beauty in it's people inside and out. the land of strong communities and beautiful traditions mixed with modernity. the land that stands for Palestine and stands for freedom.

the last Arab spring? it didn't end up well. i think that's because after Ben Ali ran away, people let thier guard down, and everything got out of hand. not because we aren't strong, just because we weren't prepared. can we be this time?

why do i not like KS? pls just wake up, he's not working with or for us, just against us if anything (the only conspirancy theory thatt i've truly beileved is that france is still controling tunis. how? take a wild guess.) i'm not trying to be rude, may Allah guide him,and guide me, and guide us all, but it's only gonna go down from here if he stays in power.

think back to ur best memories in Tunis.

think about the memories u want to make in Tunis.

think about all the people u love in Tunis.

think about all the people u love that u want to come back to Tunis.

think about all the things u love about Tunis.

think about all the things u want to improve about Tunis.

think about how amazing it would be to have a better Tunis.

now let me ask you a question, are you willing for all of this to be destroyed, to slip away. *to be stolen?*

by a man that swore on the Quran (whether ur Muslim or not, this should outrage u, nobody should swear on a holy book and then lie) to protect the constitution and then made his own?

by a man who just lies?

by the goverment he leads?

have you lost hope?

believe me when i say that i don't blame you. not for a second.

ur a human. so am i. i know what it's like to lose grip of hope and fall into desperation.

but i beg u, give urself a litle push, try to have a sliver of hope - a drop even.

give this message a chance.

give urself a chance.

give Tunisia one more chance.

if u think Tunisians have inflicted this upon themselves by not voting, I understand where ur coming from, but i hope u can understand that only god knows what they were going through, and what they were thinking. assume the best of ur brothers and sisters and give them one more chance.

we just need to give orselves a chance.

In the heart of every struggle lies the ember of hope, flickering yet unyielding. Tunisia, it's journey has been fraught with challenges, but within it resides the spirit of resilience that ignited a revolution. Remember that *change is often born from the darkest moments; it thrives in the perseverance of those who dare to dream of a brighter future.*

When the weight of despair feels heavy, look around and see the strength in unity. Every voice raised in solidarity, every act of courage, brings you one step closer to the homeland you envision—a place where justice, freedom, and opportunity flourish for all. This is not the time to give up, but to rise again, to fight with renewed vigor for the dreams that once sparked your passion.

Take a moment to breathe deeply, to remember why you should start this journey. Your hopes are valid, your struggles are real, and your fight is worth every ounce of energy.

*Hold on to each other, lift each other up, and together, reclaim the promise of Tunisia.*

\*\*\*

only god knows who's reading this. u may be standing with KS in fear of something, or in hope of a reward. and for that... i don't judge you. not for a second. i believe u might be doing that as a survival instinct almost. **it feels like 'every man for themselves' right now and i know that, BUT**

in a world that often champions the “every man for himself” mentality, it’s time to awaken to the strength that comes from unity and shared purpose. true power lies not in isolation, but in the collective spirit that binds us together. When we lift each other up, we create a force that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

imagine a Tunisia where neighbors support one another, where struggles are shared, and victories are celebrated together. this shift from self-interest to solidarity transforms not only communities but also individuals. by standing together, we amplify our voices, harness our diverse strengths, and cultivate resilience in the face of adversity.

when we fight for each other, we forge connections that break down barriers and build trust. it empowers us to advocate for change, to hold each other accountable, and to envision a future where every individual thrives. it will be 100x more benefitial in the end.

***now is the time to stand shoulder to shoulder, to fight for one another, and to build a homeland where everyone’s dreams can flourish. Together, we are unstoppable.***

\*\*\*

(this part is for my Muslims, but if ur not Muslim ur ofcourse welcome and encouraged to read)

In times of hardship, it is vital for us to remember the strength we draw from our unity and faith. Allah (SWT) reminds us in the Quran, “And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided” (Surah Al-Imran, 3:103). Together, we can face any challenge that comes our way.

We must hold on to hope, for Allah promises relief after hardship. He says, “Indeed, with hardship comes ease” (Surah Ash-Sharh, 94:6). This beautiful reminder encourages us to stay steadfast, knowing that every trial we face is a step toward the relief and freedom we seek.

As we navigate these turbulent times, let us remember the words of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, while there is good in both. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel powerless.”

No matter how difficult our circumstances may seem, we must not lose hope. Allah (SWT) is always with us, and He hears our prayers. As He assures us in the Quran, “And your Lord says, 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you'” (Surah Ghafir, 40:60). Let us raise our voices in prayer and stand firm in our commitment to justice and freedom.

After every storm, the sun will shine again. In these moments of darkness, let us be the light for one another, fostering love, support, and solidarity. Our faith and resilience will guide us through.

May Allah grant us strength, patience, and ultimate victory. Ameen.

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,"Tunisia Solo Female Trip Report: Budget, Highlights, Safety, Tips","Hi Tunisia! I (32F) wanted to share my solo trip experience to help future travelers. It's a long one so feel free to skip my post but I know a lot of people come here asking some questions

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,My thoughts on Canada as someone who has lived there for almost a decade,"There’s a lot of confusion about Canada as it’s becoming super popular right now (because of increased immigration targets), so I figured I’d clear up some confusion as someone who lived in Canada for almost a decade and know different provinces.

There’s a lot of stuff I want to tell people if they ask me for advice about moving to Canada but I refrain from saying everything because they want to hear what they like to hear otherwise they think I somehow have something against them personally.. so this is going to sound blunt but in my opinion it’s the unfiltered truth

# Canada is two countries dressed up as one

Canada has a federal system, meaning that every province in Canada controls a subset of areas, most notably things around rent/healthcare/schooling so things vary wildly between provinces including even taxes. There’s 4 main provinces where most Canadians live: Ontario (38% of population, 38% of GDP/economy), Quebec (22% of population, 20% of GDP), British Columbia (13% of population, 14% of GDP), Alberta (11% of population, 15% of GDP). However, most provinces are similar and create laws that are close to each other to make things smoother. For example, nearly all provinces have 19 as the drinking age, the same maximum interest rate you can charge…etc 

Quebec, however, is so different from the rest it can almost be its own country. It’s the only province allowed to collect its own taxes, run its own retirement program, control its own immigration. It’s also the only majority French speaking province and has very specific laws about this because they care a lot about French. It even has a different approach to housing making housing much cheaper in Quebec than anywhere in Canada (for example rent in Montreal which is one of Canada’s biggest cities is much cheaper than even small cities in Ontario not even Toronto) but Quebec also has higher taxes for the average person (and not much different for high incomers).

Quebec generally has lower economic opporurtinities compared to the other provinces (mostly due to it isolating itself with French) and pays lower salaries on higher average taxes. At the same time, it’s cheaper than the other main provinces in almost all aspects but especially in housing (Alberta being a bit similar there). 

Now onto more controversial things, Quebecois have their own distinct culture and history to the point that Quebec wanted to leave Canada which they almost did a couple of times. If you ever visit Quebec and another province, you'll notice immediately that they feel like different countries from laws to architecture to people's attitudes. While Alberta is the most right wing province, Quebec is by far the most racist and especially when it comes to muslims. It's more similar to France in this aspect (so trying to ban hijab, they even protested a muslim/maghrebi neighborhood…etc) while the rest of Canada, even Alberta, is much more accepting and is closer to the stereotypical image people have of a Canadian. Moreover, most people in the rest of Canada have not even heard of Tunisia (and sometimes Algeria). 

So when people talk about Canada, they should specify what province they’re talking about but much much more importantly Quebec or Rest of Canada, especially that up to 95% of Tunisians live in Quebec the last time I checked stats. Also, I’ll talk mostly about the rest of Canada because while I know Quebec quite well, I have never lived in it for more than 2 months. 

# Why are recent immigrants often unhappy

This is very subjective but based on my own observations. Immigraiton in Canada has shifted significantly, the federal government increased its immigraiton targets insanely (accepting 1m people a year for a country of 40m when it used to be 200-300k/yr). People come to Canada with very high expectations, they hear about healthcare, social and public services, the reputation of a high standard of living…etc and the reality ends up being different but people are shocked to see that because while they hear these stories about Italy/France, they don't know about Canada.

This happens because of many reasons

# Cost of living doesn’t match salaries 

With the surge of immigrants but no increase in housing built, housing costs have soared. You have to pay $3000/mo for a 1bd in Toronto right now. So did demand on a lot of stuff, not to mention the soaring prices across the world. People basically underestimate how much it takes to live in a big city in Canada.

Also, salaries are higher on average in Canada than most of the EU and of course way higher than Tunisia so people accept offers not knowing what kind of standard of living it will get them. Moreover, the kind of super fast immigraiton growth in Canada is not done in proportion with high paying jobs in Canada, so in other words Canada is bringing in immigrants mostly to work jobs that Canadians don’t want or work jobs that Canadians want but not at a salary Canadians would accept. 

Canadian companies also value Canadian experience and degrees and will pay you less or won’t hire you if you don’t have it. This is the case everywhere but especially true for Canada and is a well documented problem. People don’t have this problem nearly as much in the US or also to a lesser degree in the EU. Most people coming here will be underemployed (not unemployed, but working jobs they’re overqualified or underpaid for). This is hard to understand for immigrants coming to Canada because they compare it to countries with lower cost of living, it’s also why I hear that salaries in Canada are not that high compared to France…etc when in reality they are, it’s just that they’re high for people with Canadian degrees and experience. 

# Healthcare

Healthcare is free in Canada but it’s not easily available. You can wait for a year to find a family doctor and going to the ER for an emergency you can wait for 5 hours+. This is despite Canada spending insane amounts on healthcare, much more than Europe but the result is worse. I personally decided to fly to Tunisia next time I need something like a minor surgery.

# Taxes

Taxes are low compared to EU for the average person in Canada but they’re incredibly high for high incomers. It goes up to 55% marginal tax (i.e. what you pay for every extra dollar you earn). Being successful in Canada means you get destroyed by taxes while social services are not at the same level you’d find in high tax countries like Norway or Sweden. 

# Housing

Besides rent which I discussed, buying a house or apartment in most of Canada has become impossible. My salary is in the top 1% but it's not enough to buy the average house in Canada let alone in expensive cities in Canada. This is because housing prices soared in the last 10 years, making a lot of people who own a house much richer and creating a problem with housing affordability including higher rent.

# Would you recommend Canada? 

It depends on a million factors but to me, unless you can move to the US, Canada makes sense compared to EU if and only if you get a well paying job. Compared to staying in Tunisia, there's very few scenarios where I'd recommend not moving.

Canada is probably the best country to be in for someone looking for an average life (even compared to the US), taxes are low and the standard of living is pretty good compared to France/Italy/Spain minus the healthcare issue. 

If you want to move here on a below average salary or if you’re a very high income earner (200k+), Canada is a bad deal. On a below average salary, you’ll struggle with the basic necessities because they’re expensive here (rent, transportation, food). On a high income, you’ll pay insane taxes and won’t get much in return for it.

Finally, I hope this comes across as a balanced overview because trust me I’m not trying to push any agenda here. For example, I can’t own a house despite having a very high salary but it doesn’t mean I’m not living very comfortably and can afford anything I want and have savings. It also doesn’t mean I’m not unhappy with many things. I’m still recommending Canada for certain people even though I’m planning to leave to the US. It’s just that there’s a lot of nuance involved and I think the hardest thing to grasp for people when it comes to Canada is that it’s different from both EU and US so people who try to think of it from either perspective end up missing the mark.",Lived in Canada for 6 years (3 years in AB and 3 years in QC) and this is the MOST accurate description of Canada,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/15sxsf4/my_thoughts_on_canada_as_someone_who_has_lived/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Firstly I'm not dumb enough and naive enough to ask is Tunisia safe, like most cities I am traveled to I am sure it is fine you just need to be sensible.

Whilst a lot of our time will be taken in the resort it would be rather silly of me to not explore and experience the rich and vibrant history that Tunisia has to offer, with that in mind I also want to be respectful of local customs and practices and as such have a few questions. For clarification were visiting a resort in Monastir towards the Sousse end.

1. Food, I am a food lover and when visiting other countries I try to explore the local cuisine, I don't mean the ""local"" dishes they serve tourists in many resorts but I mean truly authentic local dishes. For me sea food is my passion and being on the coast I imagine the city has some amazing sea food places. With that in mind I would love your recommendation on both dishes to try and maybe even restaurant in the area.
2. When traveling the city and exploring. Am I best to hire a local guide for the day? Or explore myself, any must visit places? We plan to take a tour of Amphitheater of El Jem but any other attraction that you would say is a must? I have heard the mosques are beautiful but do they welcome visitors? I don't wish to be disrespectful and want to be as polite as possible.
3. Language and local customs. This is important to me, I appreciate the main language of Tunisia is Arabic with French being quite common, how common is English? Also any recommendeded phrases or sayings you'd suggest I learn to help communicate? I am a firm believer that as the visitor it is my duty to try to learn your language and customs and not expect the locals to cater for me. That said, I also wish to be respectful of customs and local traditions. Can anyone suggest areas or customs I should observe to be respectful, I know in some Muslim countries women should have their hair covered, outside of the resort would it be polite for my wife to do this with a scarf, or is it generally accepted that tourists wouldn't?
4.  And finally, currency and any other tips? I understand the Dinar is a closed currency and I need to get my Dinar there, I can't also take it out of the country, any tips for this? (Although I may be best asking on a travel group for this) And finally. Anything else you can suggest or tips you can give.

Thank you for taking the time and I am excited to visit your country. (And I don't just mean the holiday resort/beach)",No top comment,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fu2k6i/tips_and_questions_for_visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia as a group of women: looking for tips!,"I'm an Algerian woman in my 20s and I currently live overseas. My mother still lives in Algeria and I've been saving up to pay for a trip with her and my siblings. 

Logistics and visa paperwork are hellish so my first choice is Tunisia since my family won't need a visa and they recently opened a train line between Annaba and Tunis. 

The thing is, our entire group is made-up of women (there's my mother, then me, then my two younger sisters and my baby niece (my older sister will probably not be able to come)). We don't have a mahram (please spare me the lectures 🙏🏼) and my biggest fear when traveling is harassment. 

It's one thing to experience harassment as a woman when you're traveling with your friends but it's another thing when you're with your family. I'm genuinely scared I might lose my cool if someone bothers my mom or sisters and I might end up in trouble in a foreign country so I'm kinda worrying.

My question is: what's the best family-friendly city to visit in Tunisia? Do you have any activities to suggest too? Please drop your recommendations in the comments (not too pricey though please. I'm poor, I just wanna do something nice for my mom without declaring bankruptcy lol). I know my mom would just be fine with whatever I suggest but I really want her to enjoy the trip so if you have any idea what a 50yo woman might enjoy in Tunisia, I'm ALL EARS!!! 

btw please do not take offense with my question. I also worry about harassment even when I travel within Algeria. I just would like to prepare myself carefully since I'd be responsible for my entire family this time.

Thanks in advance!!","Don’t worry especially since your Arab/arab speaking.

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Im trying to get my boyfriend to Europe,"Hi everyone. 

For some background. I’m a third culture kid (grew up moving all over the world) who lived in Tunisia for my last year of highschool. I graduated in 2020 and in winter of 2021 I met this Tunisian  guy. I live in the Netherlands (very relevant), but we stayed in touch and this summer I came to Tunisia for 2.5 months to visit my mom who still worked there, and we spent every day since I landed together. So it’s safe to say we are in a relationship, though not very long. 

Because we spent a month and a half together almost every day. We grew super close. His English wasn’t and still isn’t amazing but through us hanging out all the time it’s really improved, so we can easily communicate. 

Anyway enough rambling,, 
So he’s expressed to me that he wants to immigrate to Europe. “Harqa” I believe it’s called. So he says he knows someone with a “safe boat” but that boat he knew just recently capsized (I think) and people died. His other option is getting a fake visa to America. But knowing American politics very well, border patrol is 10x worse and more meticulous.  They track every flight and designate border police to them to do extra thorough checks. This is even happening in Germany and France, so imagine the US. He’s so desperate to leave and I hate feeling so helpless. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is does anyone know how I can best support him? We are doing long distance as I’m back in Europe. Do I encourage him immigrating? Do I come with other options and if so does anyone know other options besides illegal immigration to get to Europe? Ie: programs etc. I have no idea how to deal with this situation but I love him a lot so I want us to have a future but most importantly help him have a promising future. 

Sorry for rambling. Any advice is appreciated :)","he needs to find a simple ,safe and legal way to go on his own .",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/15nn3j5/im_trying_to_get_my_boyfriend_to_europe/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Enfidha-Hammamet NBE airport currency exchange,"Hi, 

Travelling to Tunisia (Hammamet airport from UK) for the first time and wondering what the best way of withdrawing currency is?
Most recommendations I find is to get money at the hotel or airport, however the hotel doesnt have an ATM and I assume (from visiting most other countries) that currency exchange in the hotel/airport have very poor exchange rates? 
It appears there is no ATM in arrivals (only in departure hall)

Was hoping to use my fee free bank card to withdraw at an ATM to get better rates.

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Changes since 2016 ?,"Hi! 

I am Tunisian and I was born there, lived there until I was 15, when my parents decided to move out to France (2015). I had close to no issues adapting to the new environment and it went fine. 
Last time I visited Tunisia was in 2016 and only stayed 3 weeks and I never went back because of several personnal reasons. 
I obviously read articles and try to keep up as best as I can with the news yet I've been wondering, what are for those who still live in Tunisia, the biggest changes in your everyday life? I'm not talking about politics or stuff like that, I'm unfortunately aware of what's going on, but I'm really more interested in the day to day life. Is there any change or did any change even operate at all? Did you notice a change in the mentality, the way people act, the media, the budget, etc. or is it still the same? 


I feel kind of homesick, to be honest and I can't go back to Tunisia right now, and I've kept a very childlike memory of the country. So that's why I'm asking, I suppose, as I would love to have a more ""adultlike"" vision.","the way people act has no changed signeficantly in my opinion, the media found new ways of being trash. The budget has taken a big hit, and essential goods are now hard to find (milk, coffee, sugar...)",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/10dcrfp/changes_since_2016/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,It's time we stop complaining about Tunisians leaving and start thinking about it rationally,"I know this may be controversial. I think this is a much deeper and more complicated subject than vilifying people who leave or calling it brain drain and fantasizing about what would happen hypothetically if skilled Tunisians didn't leave...etc and because it's a deep subject I'm hoping people can take a minute and think about it without knee jerk reactions because trust me I wish it was true that simple solutions existed or that all of our problems can be fixed if skilled people didn't leave.

The main and natural hypothesis I keep hearing is that if skilled Tunisians stayed in Tunisia, the country would be better off. Also, because these Tunisians leave for a better situation for them personally, the conclusion is that, well, they were selfish and chose to benefit the west and that Tunisia's problems therefore is that its people betrayed it, otherwise it would be a success. This seems logical and I even thought that way before to a certain degree. But let's think about this from a purely rational and practical perspective.

Would Tunisia be better off if skilled Tunisians stayed? I think Tunisian companies would have been slightly better off with more talent but would they be able to harness their talent the way companies abroad would? Absolutely not. Not even close. I'll talk about software because that's the field I know deeply and that's also very relevant and important. Based on my research and things I've heard, I can say that there has not been one single purely Tunisian company, as in administratively company only registered in Tunisia and operating only through Tunisian laws, that succeeded in a major way internationally. Let me be clear, I don't mean they don't succeed because they're operated by Tunisians or have Tunisians engineers, no I mean when they operate only as a registered Tunisian company under Tunisian laws including the law of finances, and having to deal with the Tunisian ecosystem especially banks...etc

I've heard of vermeg for example but I heard [its founder literally say on radio](https://www.facebook.com/empoweredbyvermeg/posts/pfbid02KiutjeK7kySGj7pZPpiwSmqpGztAEFT1bXMVMv2445WD7ACjf1Bm2e4D7yN1G11al?__cft__[0]=AZV5ESVxbpoI94kZPyiksqocClqfEfeNErlvHNIoZYMtrOwlk4rPqX3eriL4yfKnUmNiRBp1RNJCcg9mCRMH2PlP79wlDxBZqv71-PV3wjNh-kuo_EiAPiEGTiryzZGnQmmKqyq0U77et_wYNZ7A_uanBJfZHLBBJuwav2xEG8EgFA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) that the company wouldn't have succeeded the way it did if it didn't open up a branch abroad and how that was a big catalyst of growth and even complained about huge obstacles to operating as a Tunisian company. Instadeep is another example that simply would have not been worth even 1 million dollars if it was stuck in Tunisia, [its relationship to the UK and the European market](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instadeep) was fundamental and required for its success.

So if even the most successful of Tunisian companies can't really put these skilled workers into good use, what do you think would happen if they stayed? We have no strong infrastructure for entrepreneurship, whether physical (i.e. roads, airports, flights, internet) or administrative (good and flexible banking sector to manage transactions easily but more importantly fund projects, laws building cartels, insane bureaucracy...etc) so all of those skilled Tunisians, at best, will be underemployed or in other words work jobs where they produce things that are way less valuable than they could produce or of course the more realistic scenario is actual unemployment because as everyone knows Tunisia suffers from [terrible youth unemployment](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?locations=TN), which is a problem even the mighty China is [starting to deal with](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/30/economy/china-youth-unemployment-intl-hnk/index.html).

What people seem to not realize is that companies are not just born whenever there's talent around.. no you have to have the groundwork and infrastructure to encourage their creation but also an entrepreneurial mindset. [Even Europe (especially places like France) struggle with this and the US generally is way ahead in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/europe-is-no-longer-an-innovation-leader-heres-how-it-can-get-ahead) both because of a different mindset (and laws) but also capital. So it's not enough to have talent sitting around that will magically give birth to growth. It unfortunately is not how it works.

So realistically these people are actually going to be wasted in an economy that doesn't have the companies to fully harness their skills into productivity. What will happen if they stay is they'll be largely unemployed or underemployed. They'll put a pressure on the state's expenses because of subsidies and so on but also manifest their frustration in forms that harm the economy (I'm not saying it's not justified) such as violence or protests...etc so they would be a net negative compared to the little benefit they'll bring to some Tunisian companies that quite frankly can't compete on the international market so it will barely make a difference if anything.

Now what is the alternative? Them leaving and going to countries and companies that are hungry for their skills. The same person with the same skills will produce maybe 100k dollars a year worth of productivity (not salary, I'm talking about actual value) while if they stayed in Tunisia we'd be lucky if they produced 10k/year if we're being generous because realistically they might be unemployed and consuming subsidized resources instead so more like -5k/yr. But you might think who cares? one is 100k for the west and the other is 5k for Tunisia but that's too simplistic. The money they'll produce will and does go back to Tunisia in one form or another. Tunisians abroad spend more money when they visit Tunisia compared to tourists, mostly because we target cheaper tourism.

Let's ignore that Tunisians abroad are actually a big part of tourism numbers in the first place.. but you should know that foreign currency is the blood that keeps the Tunisian Dinar alive and also the ability for Tunisia to import things it needs and to pay for its debts which in turn can potentially help its growth (when managed properly, which is not the case). Recently that [valuable foreign currency is coming a lot more from money sent from Tunisians abroad than tourism](https://www.webmanagercenter.com/2022/09/06/491928/les-transferts-des-tunisiens-residents-a-letranger-ont-atteint-les-6-milliards-de-dinars-a-fin-aout-2022/) (even though tourism is not just non-Tunisians). More importantly, unlike foreign tourism, these transfers will increase during times of crisis to support people's families while tourism revenues will disappear in those circumstances. In fact, if it wasn't for remittances which have [skyrocketed](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1240542/value-of-remittances-inflow-in-tunisia/) (and worth in 2021 alone twice as much as the IMF loan Tunisia is begging for), Tunisia would have had no money to pay for food imports if it didn't have such an elevated level of transfers from Tunisians abroad. If Tunisians stayed, they would have mostly consumed those imports instead so a net negative and even more pressure on the trade balance instead of now saving the economy..

To summarize, when you look at realistic scenarios, Tunisians moving abroad actually saved the country and that is because they would have been wasted potential if they stayed in Tunisia. However, I'm not saying that brain drain is generally good. I'm saying that Tunisia should be the last country to complain about it because it didn't build the economy needed to benefit from that and is much better off getting free money flowing in from its people who are benefiting from foreign companies (and benefiting them too of course). We don't have the right to complain about it because the alternative is simply worse and in Tunisia's case it's beneficial. We're not alone in this by the way, the Philippines for example has an economy very heavily based on remittances and [in many ways it's extremely beneficial](https://thefintechtimes.com/remittances-are-a-lifeline-for-developing-countries-with-economic-instability/), especially if you're a country that doesn't support entrepreneurship and innovation, it's free foreign currency money to use.

Keep in mind that brain drain is not as stereotypical poor to rich sort of movement as you might think. France suffers from brain drain to countries like Germany and Switzerland because they have stronger economies with more innovation, salary...etc but [Europe as a whole and even Canada suffers from brain drain to the US](https://youtu.be/_1Va0Ur0n54) because it offers a much better deal financially and has the best funded companies...etc. Some of those countries have a right to complain. India or China, for example, encourage entrepreneurship heavily (with China being a little special) and also some European countries but they still lose talent to the US because it's hard to compete with so much capital concentration in the US and its dollar based dominance too. THAT is a fair problem to complain about. Tunisia though? no you don't have the right to complain if you don't have a startup environment or a environment that encourages growth.

There's countries that reversed the trend by the way. Not because they complained very loudly, no it's because they built a strong innovation sector because guess what? people including Tunisians would love to live in their country and also be rewarded for it and also innovate. One example is Taiwan. They lead the entire world in chip manufacturing because they attracted the US educated expert taiwanese scientists and engineers back to Taiwan by creating a great environment for them. What was the result? [Taiwan is vital for the entire world's supply of microchips and not even China can touch Taiwan because it's so important](https://youtu.be/OtxZZq40JEM). It's not only Taiwan, India is currently leading a wave of attracting millions of skilled engineers back to India by creating great incentives for them and the result is that [India is growing like crazy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-23/india-s-1-4-billion-population-could-become-world-economy-s-new-growth-engine).

**TL;DR:** In conclusion, let's stop the lazy excuses. The Tunisian economy choses to be focused on traditional sectors led by people loving their traditional ways of life and it's not interested in taking advantage of its skilled people but it's very much interested in complaining about them leaving to blame someone other than themselves about the failure of the country. If we're being realistic and not dreamy of a reality that doesn't exist, people leaving Tunisia actually saved the country, it didn't ruin it and until things change drastically it's much better if people leave and give free economic help to Tunisia in the form of foreign currency remittances than stay in Tunisia and stagnate and have their skills or potential wasted.","I couldn't read the whole paragraph but all I have to say about this is : people get to live only once , I will not waste my life to make some kind of difference in a country so corrupted that it systematically refuses reform and change, I do not owe this country anything, I do not hate it and I do wish it gets fixed or gets better at least and I might help in a small way if it does not disadvantage me, but I worked hard and continue to do so for the sole objective of being financially comfortable so that I could travel and enjoy life and live my human experience to the fullest, I will not waste away on this country to pay some kind of debt I owe, people who say Tunisia spent this amount of money on med or engineering students and now they are fleeing the country and benefitting others with the skills we tought them are the worst of human scum and I hate you with all my being.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/13ah0qe/its_time_we_stop_complaining_about_tunisians/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

2) according to the website of the train provider, there's a train that leaves Tunis at 21:15 and arrives to Gabes at 04:07. How reliable is that? And at what time louage's start their trips to Djebra?

3) In general, how reliable are the (night) train schedules?

4) when do louage's operate in general? (From what time to what time)

5) to go from Gabes to Kairouan, the best way is Gabes - Sousse (Train) and then louage, or louage directly from Gabes?

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

PS: u/saihi We confirmed the fact about no-smoking signs in the restaurants and being offered and ashtray XD","Good to hear that you liked it

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Friendships in Tunisia,"I don't know whether this is only me or not, but after the BAC exam, I tend to notice a decline in friendships, the reasons for me are:

* Them going abroad to finish their studies there.
* Them going to a different Uni
* Them showing what they really are outside High School when there was no responsability.

I'm going to talk about something that happened to me (WITH ALL THE POINTS MENTIONNED), the  case is a friend, who was going abroad to finish his studies, the summer that he was going abroad, he decided to treat his life as if he had 3 months to spend before he dies, meaning that he'd try to find ways to satisfy himself, whether it is seuxal (especially) or anything else like making projects such as a Nightclub Brand. As soon as the dude has ""3 months to spend before he dies"", he kind of shown his true self, by allowing himself to play with girls, as in, be with multiple girls at the same time while most of the girls don't know that there are other girls involved. Now after a year, we got out, I honestly had the best summer with the dude and all as we visited another country (while also maintaining the same ""being with multiple girls"" personality as before, which was supposed to end). After all that fun, he got back abroad, what does he say? He had the worst summer ever and he had the shittiest experience, and his last summer was better because it had unique sensations, and he hates everyone in Tunisia. Basically showing his power over everyone thinking he's somehow superior than all Tunisians since he studies abroad.

One of the girls he been with, has told me that he hates everyone in Tunisia including me (for no reason whatsoever, we ""were"" ""bestfriends""), and he perfers his friends abroad (although when they came in Tunisia they didn't do anything but seen eachother once in 3 months), and also the girl mentionned that he only hangs out with me just to satisfy me and to keep the friendship going in case something happens.

Is this just me that sees friends just casually start hating you because once they think they've reached the top, they can just flip a switch on you?

Please reply without being irrelevant, don't copy a random sentence and only comment that sentence, I want a whole reply.

&#x200B;

TLDR; My friend changed personality and how he treats me after both seeing how much attention he gets from girls, and by also going to study abroad. Is this normal behavior?","this is so typical

we Tunisians love to fit in into stereotypes  and the stereotype for fun is what your friend did and he in fact discovered that it is not for him  and i think this is caused by an immense immaturity that we raise our children to grow up to , basically what happened to him is what i would expect to happen to literally anyone that looks/sounds like your friend

he feels superior to people that are in Tunisia ? HHHH where did he come from ?this is further proof that he is simple minded and has nothing to offer ( intellectually / human relationships )  .as for the other points well  , it happens to everyone i think both parts need to show up for the relationship and make efforts by conversations online or meetings otherwise it was just casual temporary friendship that  you have to have throughout your life.

I am a tourist visiting your country.  I am truly amazed how nice, kind, and helpful everyone has been. I saw some posts about computer science and software engineering. Being a backend software engineer myself for over 10 years in the US, I thought of giving something back in the hopes that it will help someone.

**NOTE:** Please note the regular disclaimer that these are my personal opinions and what has worked for me, so please use your own best judgement and see what works for you.

**Goal:** The goal of this post to is to provide some tips and share some resources on how to become a better software engineer. I think if you focus on becoming good engineer, jobs will follow.

Without further ado, here are some tips:

1. Pick one programming language and be really good at it. Ideally from C++, Java, or Python. Most of the companies in the industry uses these languages and the skills are very transferable. So if you know one, you’d be able to pick up any language basically.
2. Do mindful reading of books: This is very important. When you read a programming book, write the code on the compiler, yes, even if you just type what is written in the book. You’ll feel more engaged by doing it and hence would retain more information. Take lots of notes too. Don’t skim over something until you really understand it.
3. Learn basics: I cannot emphasize this enough. I have taken 100s of interviews and most of the candidates can’t answer simple basic computer science questions. Basics include (and I will share more resources below), operating systems, networking, data structures and algorithms.
4. Write code: Goes without saying, write a lot of code, like a lot! Build tools, write scripts, try and contribute into open source (this might be hard in the beginning), build a game, doesn’t matter what, just do it. This is crucial because this will help you become comfortable with taking a problem and building a solution, debugging and fixing bugs, etc. At this stage, don’t worry about writing beautiful code, just get it working.
5. Read code: When you start working in a software company, you will have to read existing code. Don’t worry if a lot of it doesn’t make sense in the beginning. Try and look for the bigger picture for example, what problem is it trying to solve. And then slowly start zooming into it, like, what is the input and what is the output supposed to be of this function. Slowly but surely you’ll develop eyes to skip over useless information and grasp the main points (which is what matters).
6. Improve design: Once you are getting hang of building software, focus on improving the design. I’ll share some book recommendations below that has helped me tremendously.
7. Problem solving: Most of the top tech companies in the US require candidates to clear at least 3 coding interviews (goes up to 5 or 6 sometimes). In these rounds, you’ll be given a problem and you’d be expected to write a working code on the compiler. All the things I’ve listed above would help with this step a lot. The trick here is to not give up. Problems will be hard, you will be frustrated in the beginning but remember we all went through with it. Just keep thinking about how you could solve it. Don’t worry about most optimal solution the first time, just get it working first.
8. System design: Now that you are all comfortable with software development, let’s focus on architecture design. There are usually one or two design interviews for senior engineers usually. The problem statement goes like, “Design Netflix homepage”. By “design” I don’t mean web design, I mean how the backend systems would look like. This is where you need to know Distributed systems basics, some database basics, caching basics, etc. Again will share resources below. For junior or entry level engineers, don’t worry about these right now. Just learn network programming (client/server programming) so you know the basics.
9. Learn scripting: This helps a lot in the real world. If you can learn some basic scripting like shell scripts, grep commands, vim, basic linux commands, etc. It will make your life infinitely easier in the real world.
10. Ask questions: A lot of questions. I still ask a lot of questions. If you are passionate about learning, most people would be willing to share their knowledge with you and would be willing to help you. Don’t worry about dumb questions or anything. There are no dumb questions. Try to grasp as much as you can. You won’t understand everything at first and that’s okay. That will always happen. Just try and understand what you can and see if you can google and learn what you didn’t. Finally, if Google didn’t help either, ask the person.
11. Use ChatGPT: It’s amazing how that tool works for learning. Some prompts I use to learn are: “Explain X to me like you’d explain to a 15 year old” followed by “Write sample code in Java for this”. Give this a shot. You can ask as many questions to it for even every line and it will explain. I have used it while I was in Tunisia and it seems to work here for free.

Here are some resources that I found useful:

* Beej’s guide to network programming: [https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) Excellent tutorial on client server programming. Absolute basics of web services development. Must read!
* Stanford CS Ed library for basics on linked lists, binary trees, etc. [http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/)
* [Leetcode.com](http://leetcode.com/) for problem solving practice. Do basics first before jumping into this one. Similar thing you can do at [topcoder.com](http://topcoder.com/) for trying to code with a timer. Great for problem solving practice.
* [Highscalability.com](http://highscalability.com/) for learning about different company’s architecture. Beginners can skip this for now or read it you find it interesting.
* [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cassandra-the-definitive/9781098115159/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cassandra-the-definitive/9781098115159/) first few chapters provide an awesome introduction to NoSQL databases (used a lot in the industry). Highly recommended even if you read the first 50 pages. Covers CAP theorem and all IIRC.

Must know data structures:

Below are bare minimum of the data structures that you must know. Listing them in order:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Binary trees
4. Binary search trees
5. Hash Table
6. Stack
7. Queues
8. Heap
9. Graphs (Important to know BFS, DFS, and Topological sort at the very minimum)
10. Balanced binary tree (bit complex)
11. TreeHashMap (Java specific)

Books/Online tutorials:

* Algorithms: Books are sometimes a bit too complex. I’d recommend listening to videos on YouTube instead. This guy is pretty good: [https://www.youtube.com/@tusharroy2525](https://www.youtube.com/@tusharroy2525)
   * Algorithms in C++ by Robert Sedwick
   * The Algorithm Design Manual
* Object oriented and languages:
   * Head first object oriented design (Amazing book)
   * Head first design patterns
   * Clean code by Robert Martin (This guy has amazing blog too)
   * Refactoring
   * Effective C++
   * More Effective C++
   * Effective Java (The best book on Java)
   * Java concurrency in practice (Amazing book on basics of threading in Java)
* Use Coursera and Udacity and sign up for free courses. I’d recommend intro courses like building a search engine 101 on Udacity is pretty good.
* For System design interviews, check out ""Grokking the system design interview"" book/course. 
   * There is some questionable design in this book but overall it's a very good guide on the format and how to approach the problem.   

This all may look like a lot but please know that you don’t have to do all at once. Take your time and start somewhere. Make slow steady progress and you’ll get hang of it. Once you do, you’d be surprised how easy it is.

All the best! I hope this helps someone!","> I am tourist in your country

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,What's the best tourist tour you can recommend for a group of 400 tourists in August?,"Hi everyone,

I'm part of the organizing committee of an international congress that's happening at the beginning of August and looking for your recommendations concerning the best tourist places that the tourists can visit during a single day sequentially.

Preferably not mainstream places such as Sidi Bou Said or Medina due to the high traffic and the density of people as the number of guests is too high (400)","I'd recommend doing Dougga, Djebba, Testour. You can also do Zaghouan: Water Temple + Old Medina.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/sqyftg/whats_the_best_tourist_tour_you_can_recommend_for/,Unknown,Recommendation,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Solo female travel to Tunisia,"I am seriously considering traveling to Tunisia for 3 to 4 weeks starting in about a month, so late November in to December. I'm just not having a good go at getting recent first hand accounts on what the experience would be like as a solo female western traveler (I'm from the US). I only speak English and very, very basic French. Currently no travel experience in Northern Africa, but I will have been to Egypt right before this. As far as other experience in Muslim and/or Arab countries/areas I have spent a month in Turkey and time in Palestine.

If anyone has any insight as well as links for resources for reading, or recommendations/advice, I would be quite grateful. Mainly trying to get a feel for safety/comfort factor as well as ease of transportation around the country. If anyone has an tips on places to go or avoid that would be great too. I know the basics from what I have been able to read at this point, but alot of the first hand reports I have read are quite dated and speak to alot of hassling and not feeling safe alone. Also, if you have a recommendation for best SIM card to get which would have the most reliable/fast coverage.

Thanks!

Edit to add question about internet.","A couple of thing.  I'm not sure if you're from the US but if you are, make sure you enroll in the STEP program we have here.

I'm an American (Guy) here in Tunisia but this is something that should be a requirement, honestly.  This lets the Embassy know of your general whereabouts while here.  If you're from elsewhere, check out your Embassy if they have a registration program as well.

Generally, females are safe here.  I would say that you need to make sure that you use best practices.  This is a modest/Muslim country so I'd recommend not wearing anything too risque or would attract attention.  You probably won't be targeted more for your being female but more so that you're a tourist so, make sure you're on guard when out and about, just as you would anywhere else.

I've lived in Tunisia for 4 years and I've never had an issue.  My wifes sister had her phone snatched from Her but that's all I know of any sort of crime personally.  I have a co-worker who said people stole his bike but he was out late at night in a neighborhood he shouldn't have been in.  Again, use safe practices while out.

If you would like a local contact, I can be one.  They're good to have.  My wife is Tunisia and speaks English really well.  We both work at the US Embassy here so, we could try to help as best as we could.

As far as best SIM card, I've had Orange for a while now and I like them.  Wife uses Orange too.  TunisiaTelecom I would avoid like the plague.  Ooredoo I'm not a huge fan of but that's just customer service side that I had issues with them.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9ric3v/solo_female_travel_to_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,it
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,best city to stay for family of three?,"Hi there, hoping for a little help, I am planning on visiting Tunisia with my wife and child in a month, we are looking to stay for 7 days and mostly want to stay somewhere which has beautiful beaches, we are usually active but having a child we will be relaxing a bit more than exploring.

We want somewhere which will offer nice beaches, have something to do outside of the resort ( I will be exploring the city ) has good places to eat and will just be fun for a family of three, I am looking at all inclusive hotels and Hammamet & Sousse keep popping up.

This will be our first time in Tunisia, we usually travel to Agadir Morocco and have a blast there so a city quite similar would be perfect.","I will personnally recommend Sousse.

Sousse is great for families because it have nice beaches, a lot of family activities( Port El Kantaoui, Medina,...) various restaurants and cultural activities.

Plus Sousse is in the center of many sites and cities: You can easily travel from Sousse to the capital, Monastir, Kairouan, Hammamet, Mahdia, you have a zoo that in my memories was great in Enfidha( Friguiya park), etc.

So it's a good compromise because you can spend a day just in the beach in Sousse and the other day visiting the city, plus you can easily visit another city if you get tired of Sousse.

Only problem is that you'll be far away from the desert.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/u7rotr/best_city_to_stay_for_family_of_three/,"Unknown, Tunis, Sousse, Hammamet",Recommendation,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,"Advice please in regards to which city to choose for a month between Tunis, Monastir, Sousse and Sfax","Hey everyone, this summer in July I am supposed to go on a 1 month medical exchange to Tunisia, and I have to choose a city between Tunis, Monastir, Sousse and Sfax to do my exchange in a hospital. I would love any pointers or advice from you all.  


\> I only speak English, can read Arabic but not speak it well at all, nor French. Is that a problem for any of the cities? Or which one of them will only English be more than helpful in?

\> Does the quality of hospitals differ between the cities? Might be a weird question so sorry about that, but like in my own country the major cities generally tend to have a better hospital and facilities in general.

\> Which city overall would you recommend as the best for a student staying for a month? In terms of safety, friendliness, enjoyment etc  


\> Interested in any general advice for the visit as well! Any tips, must-do's, things to remember etc :)

Thanks for taking out time to answer, very excited to see the lovely country this summer!","Tunis as a city would be better, the cultural scene is richer and there are more trendy events and locations... 
Sousse and Monastir (similar and 20min away from eachother) are better to go to the beach and chill. 
The hospitals in Tunis are better equipped but can be very crowded and chaotic. 
depends wich Hospital tho. 
Under no circumstances go to sfax, it‘s an industrial city and theres absolutely no fun there. 
The private sector is slowly eating the public health sector in Tunisia, our hospitals were once our pride. But they are too old now and not well managed.

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Thoughts about Tunisia 5,"  Most people of this group are blessed. Because they belong to those who have the chance to live in more than one country. This is a freedom that should not be taken for granted nor taken lightly. This is a privilege. We have seen more than one country in our lifetime. We have traveled. We took our bags and we left our countries and we have seen other parts of the world and by that decision alone we changed ourselves too. We have seen with our own eyes and we have felt with our own senses. And we have made memories that will live on forever with us and that would even have an effect on all our latter decisions and on all the people that we know. A few hundred years ago such enterprise was barely imaginable and travelling was restricted to a few privileged and financed with gold from Kings and Barons. Today we live in the globalization age. If you have the means, you could make it happen. I remember around 2009 I was reading an article about Cristiano Ronaldo travelling from Spain to the USA in his private jet to attend a highly prominent party in a lush nightclub somewhere there and that he would be back to training in Real Madrid the next day. The article included a picture of the star accompanied by a beautiful brunette, both of them laughing and holding drinks in their hands. I follow football. During one game of the German team the commentator mentioned that a player named Jerome Boateng is accustomed to travelling to Paris just for the sole purpose that his preferred haircutter is located there. Okay these are extreme examples that might be criticized for the unnecessary pollution caused by the private jets but I was trying to show that people always find a reason to travel and that technology and logistics nowadays have reached an unprecedented progressed level in the history of mankind. Tunisia is near Europe. 2 flight hours and you find yourself in a European metropolis in a whole different world. I love the feeling of travelling. Even within Tunisia itself travelling can give you such a healing and reviving feeling. Some unexpected beautiful suddenly perceived landscapes or horizons could hit one’s soul in an incomprehensible way. The sight of the reflection of the sun on a lake could make you feel something transcendental. You would just be in awe of the beauty of the uncustomary sighting.  Like something extremely important is calling you to understand it or to remember it. Nature is such a great phenomenon that is why we Tunisians must preserve our environment and cease polluting it. But travelling does not just involve landscapes and nature but primarily people too. What I most love about travelling is meeting new faces, new people with new attitudes and reactions and learning from them and exchanging stories and life experiences. For instance I remember a French girl I met in school because she belonged to an exchange program where students from France would visit us in Tunisia. She noticed that I was highly interested in a book in her hands called “If this is a man” by Primo Levi. She just gave me the book and said to me that I can keep it. As I was looking for money in my pockets to pay her she refused and insisted that I can have that book as a gift from her. And she added “Can I not give without having to get something in return?”. In French it sounds simpler : “ Faut il toujours avoir pour donner? That question startled me. This happened about 20 years ago and I still remember her words to this day. So powerful was that moment to me. Until then I never asked myself that question and until then I was taught that if you give without getting something back that means you were a fool and a dumb person but her decision at that moment rattled that conviction and unfounded it. And I learned maybe for the first time to see things from another perspective. Seeing things from other perspectives. This is what travelling is all about. What is highly important here could be trivial over there. What is mostly holy or complicated over there might be normal and simple over here. Each one of us has his own unforgettable memories that helped define him and that helped explain the world for him. Each one of us has met somewhere someday that stranger who leaved a nice impression and who engrained a word or an expression in our consciousness. We are a product of our environments in some sense and travelling could only bring richness of character with it and an increase of the strength of personality. And for those who cannot afford travelling believe me when I tell you that reading is the ultimate way of travelling. You just read a good book and at the end of it you will find out that you most probably have made the best journey you could possibly make. If I may share a discovery I made during my last lecture, I came across the term “ Aspen tree”. That kind of tree does not exist in Tunisia and they have special leaves that make very special sounds. The leaves flutter in the lightest wind. I typed aspen tree in youtube and I found several videos dedicated to the calming relaxing natural sound that these leaves make. Our world is so rich and technology nowadays brings us even the sounds of the tropical forest with the birds and creatures that we never saw and otherwise would never have heard. Just always remember we are blessed and we should say thanks.","Thanks for the full immersion Faracha, your writings never disappoints.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/y2xxe2/thoughts_about_tunisia_5/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia,"3aslema, 

I'm planning to visit Tunisia this summer (for a longer time - 2 - months months probably). I studied Arabic at university, and I speak Tunisian dialect (although not bel gdé bel gdé 😅) and I just love Tunisia. I have a few questions, first being, how much would I need to save out for rent (if I were to rent let's say s+0 or s+1 in Sousse for example) and what would be the best place to look to rent an apartment for 2 - 3 months (June, July and August; and not expensive stuff like AirBnb..). Also, since I'll be working online, is there a way to get a good, steady internet connection, because last time I had Orange and it wasn't really good (that was 2019 though).

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia for a week in May. Recommendations (in particular regarding staying in Sousse)?,"Hello everyone,

I'll be visiting Tunisia in May, landing in Enfidha and departing from Tunis after 8 days. I'm mostly interested in visiting the historical and architectural sites, as well as spending some afternoons and evenings relaxing by the beach or at a bar if weather permits. Since a week isn't too much time, I'll be focusing on Tunis/Carthage/Sidi Bou Said around the capital, and the area around Sousse/Monastir/El Jem/Kairouan further south. 

My current plan would be to book an accommodation for 4-5 nights somewhere in Sousse, and 2-3 nights in Tunis. Sousse appeals to me because as far as I can tell it's got nice beaches and good touristic infrastructure, while also being the main transportation hub in the area which would make it easy to do a bunch of short day trips to the other sites by train or louage (I really rather not rent a car). However, I've also read that it can be quite hectic in the touristic season, but I'm hoping things will still be relatively calm in May (would that be the case?) Alternatively, I've read that Monastir and Mahdia in particular are calmer with even better beaches, but of course with the trade-off not not being as well connected as Sousse.

So, does Sousse sound like it would best suit my needs? If so, what particular areas, beaches, or accommodations would you recommend? It doesn't have to be a standard hotel/resort, as a matter of fact I'd be interested in alternative/unique accommodations that you may be familiar with. Ideally tough I'd like to stay within walking distance to a beach and maybe some restaurants/bars.

Thanks for reading!

There are tons of useful posts here discussing the safety issues for travelers but they are mostly for white / Caucasian tourists. Unfortunately from my experience of traveling around the world, Asians are often the easy targets for scamming / robbery / harassment and street violence. I'm not overly worried but just want to get some insights from you guys and see what would the situation look like.

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,"What I know of Tunisia is that it is the Arab's Spring success story. Is this true? If so, why is its role so underrated in the Arab Spring's history?","Hi. Press about Tunisia has been sporadic in the West at best about Tunisia, so about three years ago I went there on vacation for 2 weeks. I decided to drive around and couchsurf. The people I met and the places I visited made my time there an absolute wonder.

I liked to talk about how the country was doing, and met with a few guys from a local atheist group. A British historian who had been there for 40odd years. A 25 year old Tunisian girl who I fell in love with, and made out with secretly, safe distance away from the woman's hostel where she lived. I spoke with liberal elite intellectuals in Tunis, and even with the then campaign manager from Nidaa Tounes, because there were elections coming up. That was all in fluent English.

I loved it then, but only now realize my limited slice of Tunisia I saw. With many locals I only had small conversations in my very limited French. No deep discussions. 

Still, in 2014 Tunisia felt to me as a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany. (I was there then as a visitor but I was only 10. So what did I know...) I haven't been to Tunisia since then, and news is sparse. 

I noticed how Wikipedia's Arab Spring page doesn't place Tunisia front and center of the Arab Spring. The lead-up to the Arab Spring omits Bouazizi's story. The 'results' doesn't speak about Tunisia's successes. I find all that lack of attention so incredibly odd. Are we missing a success story, or is there nothing to celebrate? 

And that's why I came here:

How is Tunisia doing?
And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?
Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?
Where is Tunisia going to?

TL;DR: Anyone providing any insight into the questions above would be great.

PS As a thank you to the country and its role in the Arab Spring, I went to Mohamed Bouazizi's grave and took a picture of his grave for Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi ","
>How is Tunisia doing?

From which side? 

i'm gonna presume you mean overall 
Well economicly the government made new austerity measures in order to reduce the budget deficiency to less than 5%, well that was good on paper until the new measuers took place since it fueled many protests across the country under the slogan ‘فاش نستنو‘ 'what are we waiting for', people are talking about a sencond Uprising especially since tomorrow happens  to be the 8th revolution memory 

>And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?

As it is mentioned  above there is no big interest in our country since we're a small one with limited natural resources 

>Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?

short answer : no

Long answer : Bouazizi was not a war hero, he was some random guy who felt the oppression and decided enough is enough and sat himself on fire, during ben ali regime the question was not who is gonna start the uprising, it's when 

>Where is Tunisia going to?

Nobody knows for now but hopefully  to a better place

Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Questions about living in your country ahead of my 3 month visit,"Hi /r/Tunisia! I will be staying in Tunis for the next three months for a summer job and I am incredibly excited. However, this will be my first time in your beautiful country or even in Africa, which is why I have some questions ahead of my visit that I would appreciate answers to :) 

1. What is the level of English proficiency amongst Tunisians (especially in Tunis)? I know that Arabic and French are the two main languages whilst English is less commonly know, but as someone with no Arabic knowledge and very basic French proficiency, will I be able to survive just on speaking English around the capital or should I revise some basic French phrases?
 
2. Phone Sim Card: Any suggestions as to which provider I should go with, what plan is the best value for money? I definitely need 3G internet access always, so I need a plan with lots or even unlimited data as well as good reliable coverage. 

3. Safety concerns: I've been reassured several times by my employers that the country and city is safe to visit, but I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you have tips about things that I shouldn't do, places I shouldn't visit etc.?

4. The summer heat: how do you guys stay cool? I see that the temperatures can reach above 40 degree celsius, and as someone who has lived in western Europe most of my life, that is really making nervous that I won't be able to stand the heat. Are most buildings air conditioned? Any tips about how to sleep at night, (which I am most worried about)?
5. This might be a somewhat weird question, but what do Tunisians think of Chinese people (I am Chinese). Do people in the capital see many Chinese people (i'm thinking tourists). Will I get looks and stares around the city if I just go on a jog or a walk alone? 

Thank you for reading this long post! Any advice/tips/suggestions that are not related to the questions above would also be appreciated (must-dos, places to eat, things to try etc) :) ","I'll try to answer some of your questions
**1.** I suggest sharpening your French, Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) won't really do much for you anyways
**3.** The more poor a place looks the more reason you should stay away
**4.** At night it gets cooler not chilly but cool enough to let you sleep at night it might get getting used to you'll manage
**5.** You might get a few looks but most of the time it won't be ill-favored",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6ms27x/questions_about_living_in_your_country_ahead_of/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Has it happened to any other visiting women in Tunisia? ,"Not sure if it's the right place to share such a thing, but I can't think of any other. It's my first post and I hope I do not offend anyone. A very unpleasant situation happened to me in Tunisia and I wonder if it was just me or maybe there were more accidents like this. Importantly, please, don't take me wrong, I believe that Tunisian people are great and so is the country regardless of this accident.

The said situation happened in one of the so-called ""good"" hotels. During the holidays, me and my partner were staying in one of the rooms located separately from the main building. Very unreasonably, we left the balcony door open, it was hot, we also felt secure in that place. In the middle of the night my partner woke me up by getting up to go to the toilet. Very soon after he went to the toilet I felt a very ""particular"" touch from someone who was not my partner - I opened my eyes, it was dark, my partner was in the bathroom at that time behind closed doors. I could tell that ""someone"", a dark shape of, had noticed that I was not asleep anymore and left the room through the balcony. It all lasted about 3-5 seconds. I froze completely when I saw this person, called my partner after I regained my mind along with my ability to speak. The person was obviously gone by then. It seems bizarre and unrealistic, but it still haunts me. I have no proof it happened apart from a very vivid and disturbing memory of it. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this in Tunisia?  
Please, could anyone advise me anything apart from letting it go and hoping to forget, what perhaps I should do now?","I’m so sorry you experienced this incredibly uncomfortable incident, how incredibly creepy and scary. 

To answer your question, I’m Swedish and I’ve been to Tunisia many times (in fact, I arrived yesterday once again lol) and nothing like this has ever happened to me. I have visited close to 50 countries and to be very honest, this can happen anywhere in the world. I don’t think this specific incident you’re describing is particularly common in Tunisia, like you would more commonly find men approaching you intensely depending on where you are in the country and time of day. 

If you are still here I hope the rest of your trip goes well, and if I were you I would notify the hotel about this. Tunisia is a lovely country to visit and hopefully this horrifying incident hasn’t ruined your experience here and perception of the country as a whole.

Also, if there are any tourist scams/dangers I need to be aware of?

Thanks for your help!

I'll be staying in Enfidha incase you need to know. ","To avoid scams by taxi drivers in Tunisia, I recommend downloading the Bolt app as soon as you arrive. Bolt functions similarly to Uber, offering fixed, transparent prices. While these fares may sometimes be slightly higher than those of traditional taxis you’d hail on the street, the app ensures you’ll know the exact fare before your ride begins.

If a driver asks for extra payment beyond what’s displayed on your phone, politely but firmly decline and ask for an explanation. In most cases, they won’t have a valid reason. If they do, remind them that the fare shown in the app is the agreed-upon price. This way, you can avoid overcharges and have a more secure experience.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ghu6ty/hi_guys_im_visiting_tunisia_next_week_for_the/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,best time to visit Tunisia,Moroccan from the Netherlands visiting tunisia! What to expect?," I (25M) will be visiting tunisia (tunis) during new year this year.

 I live in the Netherlands but I am of moroccan origin so I speak arabic/french fluently, therefore I assume language won't be a problem.

My questions are the following:

1) When traveling europe there are plenty of local groups online where you post and meet people to roam around and explore the city.

So far I didn't find anything like that I tried expats/travel tunis Facebook for example but the only posts I find are people selling stuff like tables and closets...

Are there any online communities you recommend?

2) How does your currncy work? 

I was looking into some menus and restaurants online and for a soup it said 9000 DT I did a conversion and like 2800 euros... 

I am very confused by it lol.

3) I there anyone up for meeting and hanging out?

4) Do apps like Uber or Careem work in Tunisia?

5) What to look out for and what are your biggest advices for me as a first time visitor to tunis?

Although we share a lot of common culture among us I don't want to come to your country as a guest and do anything disrespectful hence the questions and the long post!

Thank you in advance dear Tunisians, lakom kol a 7ob wa ta9dir!","Hello.

1. I don't use Facebook, can't help.
2. A Tunisian Dinar is made up of 1000 Millimes. Most people use millimes for smaller amounts, so if a menu says ""9000"" it is 9 TND. If a vendor says ""2000"" it is 2 TND. A ""million"" is 1000 TND.
3. I'm abroad, can't help.
4. In Tunisia, you can use Bolt. But it is limited to the major cities. It's probably better to just use taxis or other transport.
5. Enjoy yourself, be aware and mindful as with any destination where you're a tourist, and don't be shy when it comes to rejecting ""help"" from people trying to sell you stuff.

Thanks everyone!","Welcome to Tunisia! I am not from those areas, so probably I can(t offer any useful advice, but in general, bare in mind Tunisia can be very hot and suffocating in July. In tozeur people only go out when the sun is down in summer because it is hell outside. 

Can you re-adjust your visit timing? Probably October-May is the best period. You can visit the north though, there are breath taking forests and natural sights in Binzart and Beja. Also, the capital is culturally rich, and you can have a blast there while visiting shadowed places.

As for the visits, I am not sure about the GYG tours pricing but I know that people in the south are generally kind and you won't be scammed if you well negociate with them. I visited the south before and it is pretty easy to move around in a car, maybe consider that? Also, there are many museums and places you can be guided through anyways. I think the best is to get advice from someone in that area, maybe post again asking to talk with someone in Tozeur/ Douz?

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Tips and questions for visiting Tunisia. ,"Firstly I appreciate this must get asked a lot so thank you for taking the time. Myself and my family are booked to visit Tunisia next June and I have some questions regarding visiting Tunisia that I'd appreciate help on.

Firstly I'm not dumb enough and naive enough to ask is Tunisia safe, like most cities I am traveled to I am sure it is fine you just need to be sensible.

Whilst a lot of our time will be taken in the resort it would be rather silly of me to not explore and experience the rich and vibrant history that Tunisia has to offer, with that in mind I also want to be respectful of local customs and practices and as such have a few questions. For clarification were visiting a resort in Monastir towards the Sousse end.

1. Food, I am a food lover and when visiting other countries I try to explore the local cuisine, I don't mean the ""local"" dishes they serve tourists in many resorts but I mean truly authentic local dishes. For me sea food is my passion and being on the coast I imagine the city has some amazing sea food places. With that in mind I would love your recommendation on both dishes to try and maybe even restaurant in the area.
2. When traveling the city and exploring. Am I best to hire a local guide for the day? Or explore myself, any must visit places? We plan to take a tour of Amphitheater of El Jem but any other attraction that you would say is a must? I have heard the mosques are beautiful but do they welcome visitors? I don't wish to be disrespectful and want to be as polite as possible.
3. Language and local customs. This is important to me, I appreciate the main language of Tunisia is Arabic with French being quite common, how common is English? Also any recommendeded phrases or sayings you'd suggest I learn to help communicate? I am a firm believer that as the visitor it is my duty to try to learn your language and customs and not expect the locals to cater for me. That said, I also wish to be respectful of customs and local traditions. Can anyone suggest areas or customs I should observe to be respectful, I know in some Muslim countries women should have their hair covered, outside of the resort would it be polite for my wife to do this with a scarf, or is it generally accepted that tourists wouldn't?
4.  And finally, currency and any other tips? I understand the Dinar is a closed currency and I need to get my Dinar there, I can't also take it out of the country, any tips for this? (Although I may be best asking on a travel group for this) And finally. Anything else you can suggest or tips you can give.

Thank you for taking the time and I am excited to visit your country. (And I don't just mean the holiday resort/beach)",No top comment,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fu2k6i/tips_and_questions_for_visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir",General,en
Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia as a group of women: looking for tips!,"I'm an Algerian woman in my 20s and I currently live overseas. My mother still lives in Algeria and I've been saving up to pay for a trip with her and my siblings. 

Logistics and visa paperwork are hellish so my first choice is Tunisia since my family won't need a visa and they recently opened a train line between Annaba and Tunis. 

The thing is, our entire group is made-up of women (there's my mother, then me, then my two younger sisters and my baby niece (my older sister will probably not be able to come)). We don't have a mahram (please spare me the lectures 🙏🏼) and my biggest fear when traveling is harassment. 

It's one thing to experience harassment as a woman when you're traveling with your friends but it's another thing when you're with your family. I'm genuinely scared I might lose my cool if someone bothers my mom or sisters and I might end up in trouble in a foreign country so I'm kinda worrying.

My question is: what's the best family-friendly city to visit in Tunisia? Do you have any activities to suggest too? Please drop your recommendations in the comments (not too pricey though please. I'm poor, I just wanna do something nice for my mom without declaring bankruptcy lol). I know my mom would just be fine with whatever I suggest but I really want her to enjoy the trip so if you have any idea what a 50yo woman might enjoy in Tunisia, I'm ALL EARS!!! 

btw please do not take offense with my question. I also worry about harassment even when I travel within Algeria. I just would like to prepare myself carefully since I'd be responsible for my entire family this time.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Looking for tourism tips in Tunisia,"Hello guys,

I will be visiting Tunisia during November for a couple of weeks coming from Northern Europe. Really looking forward! I'm planning to stay in AirBNBs and travel between various cities to see and experience as much as I can. I'm not interested in tourist hotels or restaurants that make European food. I don't want to create an artificial barrier between me and local culture. I want to try Tunisian cuisine, experience local activities, feel the culture. I wanted to ask the community for some tips and tricks - anything that has to do with the late autumn season, tourists from Europe and their safety, must-visit places. My questions are genuine and if they sound harsh - I'm not looking to insult anyone, just to know what should I be worried about and what is fine. I understand every place has its own culture and unwritten rules and I'm looking to learn that.  


\- What cities / particular locations are of interest and must see?  
\- Is the cuisine similar throughout the country or various regions have their top dishes? What are the top dishes to try? (I don't have dietary restrictions)  
\- How's the bus / train infrastructure between the cities? Is there a website to pre-order tickets?  
\- Is it safe for the foreigner to drive around? How's the bribery culture? Should I expect being stopped by the police for the bribes without a reason?  
\- How's the night life? Is it a thing to go to the bars or night clubs during the weekend and what places are recommended to go to?  
\- Any strong DO NOTs? (I.e. never go to the Mosque with shorts, etc.)  
\- Should I be worried about jewellery and travel without it or is it generally safe in the streets?  
\- Maybe you feel there is something I didn't mention, but it is worth considering?  


Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward so much to this trip. :)","I will get back to qsts 1&2 later in the comment.

3/ the bus & train infrastructure in the country is barely average. There is no website you could pre-order tickets. You basically have to arrive at the station to buy ur tickets. The thing that will make you probably not choose trains/buses is confort & time which is the opposite of what you want. It takes you around 3 hours for around 200 km. And yes it is not comfortable in anyway. The best option for you in this case might be driving.. so renting a car. It costs you around 150 TND [our currency] per day. 
4/ It is safe for you to drive around. There is a high chance you would be stopped by the police yes BUT there is no reason for you to worry as long as you have the necessary papers. There are 4 necessary papers, ownership of the car/ insurrance on the car/ Valid driving liscence & ID. Ignore their attempts to take money as a bribe, if they have nothing against you you're safe. Also just a side note, as long as you're a foreigner they are more precautious when dealing with you.
5/ Night life in Tunisia is fine, it actually meets the purpose. I mean if you want smwhere to go out, have a few drinks and enjoy your night. It's really easy. Don't expect anything extra like themed parties, special events or really hardcore all_night parties . Don't also expect to be sweating on the dance floor since the music will probavly send you off (haha) but it's not bad overall. 4 cities are known with decent nightlife culture (Djerba-Hammamet-Sousse & Gammarth in Tunis) 
6/ My answer is there is not a single strong do not. Just stay out of trouble, like physical fighting or any form of violence .  Don't seek attention and it should be enough to keep you safe.
7/ With jewelry you're safe unless it's really late at night and the streets are empty.. Like if there is no one around and you are WALKING down the street with some jewelry and your phone in your hands, it would put you in some risk. My advice for you is keep it simple, nothing extravagant like a huge gold chain on your neck or anything of this sort and it should be good.  

Now going back to the first 2 questions. 
What cities and what to do in them really depend on your taste. There is a bit of everything. There is so much to see in different cities and it's convenient that Tunisia isn't a huge of a country so you could make it to the north/south/ coast during the same vacations. 
Since you're staying during the winter I'd say you visit Tozeur  in the south for the Sahara settings.
For food, try out different things and see what you like. 
I'll let the chance for others to elaborate more on these two subjects.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia for the first time! Hoping for travel recommendations.,"Hi r/Tunisia. Hope you're all finding balance and strength throughout the pandemic.

My fiancé and I are traveling to Tunisia from Montréal later this month. Our itinerary has us in Tunis for a few days, then Djerba, then a Sahara tour, and then back in Tunis to close it all out. We'll be in the country for ten days total. 

I've got a couple specific (maybe weird?) questions that I'm hoping you could answer. Any tips would be massively appreciated.

1) Places to see live music in Tunis. In particular, I'm a huge fan of Anouar Brahem, the Tunisian oud player, so traditional music would be amazing. But any music really (assuming the pandemic hasn't shut all that down).

2) Seafood restaurants in Tunis or Djerba. Not looking for anything fancy, but ideally somewhere that serves octopus. Love octopus.

3) Somewhere where I can buy or develop 35mm film. I'll be taking photos during the trip and would prefer to have them developed in Tunis rather than risk the negatives being scanned at the airport. Somewhere that sells old vintage cameras would be a bonus!

4) Places to buy vinyl records?

5) Tips on getting a PCR test done in Tunis. I tried using the booking website but it seems like we need to either call or visit in person, rather than book online. If anyone can point us to the a reliable testing centre in Tunis it'd be super helpful.

4) And just food recommendations in general, or places in Tunis and Djerba that you think fly under the radar. Or general travel tips/precautions that we should know.

[My monthly income since i decided to start Freelancing in 2012 + overall details on each period. Feel free to ask anything, i'll be glad to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/)

I answered a lot of common questions in that thread so make sure to read it whenever you can, am also still doing ""freelancing"" sort of speak, am not constantly hunting for client anymore though, been working on a long term projects for years now, and i have my own company here (SUARL totalement exportatrice) in order to legitimize the whole thing, money is really good and i still work from home, feel free to ask anything.

&nbsp;

With that said, here are some answers for some of the frequently asked questions: 


------

#FAQ 
#Tunisia-related (money, legal shit, etc ...)

**How do i get paid ?**

* It depends, if you work with one of the famous platforms (upwork, fiverr) then you could use a payoneer card, but if you meet your client ""randomly"" in some forum (r/forhire, r/gameDevClassifieds, /r/slavelabour ) then you just have to talk it out, in the past i used :

* Payoneer card-to-card payement (client must have a payoneer card)

* Westerunion (expensive, avoid that)

* [WorldRemit](https://www.worldremit.com/en/tunisia/faq/cash-pickup#where-can-my-recipient-collect-the-funds-in-tunisia) (super cheap WesternUnion alternative)

* Bank wire (but don't do it for large amounts, anything less han 2000tnd should be fine)

&nbsp;

**Does payoneer work in Tunisia ?**

* Yes (but you really can't be a freelancer if you can't make a simple google search...)

&nbsp;

**Will they send me a MasterCard to my home??**

* yes

&nbsp;

**W diwena 😲??? ma yotlbouch 3leya rachwa ??**

* No

&nbsp;

**Can i send money from payoneer directly to my tunisian bank account?**

* Yes. 

Edit: few months ago i discovered that this is illegal, it is actually illegal to even have *ANY* money-service outside of Tunisia as a Tunisian citizen, you can only do that if you have residency outside of Tunisia.

Though they are not controlling this, I would highly recommend you never send money from payoneer to your Tunisian bank account, you can still use the ATM without any issues though.

&nbsp;

**What ATM do you use with Payoneer and how much they cost**

* I never used Payoneer credit card in a Tunisian ATM since 2016, i only use it online or when i travel. 

* The fees are available in [Payoneer's fee page](https://www.payoneer.com/about/fees/)

* No the Tunisian government won't bother you.

&nbsp;


**can i link a tunisian paypal account to payoneer account ?**

* Yes

**can i use that paypal account to buy things ?**

* Most of the time yes (ebay, steam, g2a, etc..), but it doesn't work for subscriptions (like Netflix), for that you have to use your payoneer Mastercard directly, also some other services that doesn't have our countries in their supported list (like Nintendo and Playstation) won't accept neither your paypal nor your payoneer card


&nbsp;

**can i use that paypal account to receive money?**

* No


&nbsp;

**I don't have a payoneer account yet, and i need to pay some international fees (eg: Google/Apple dev account fees)**

* Get a ""Carte technologique""

&nbsp;

**My Client doesn't have a payoneer card what should i do?**

* When it comes to working with beginners, most clients would like to work with you through a proxy-service (fiverr, upwork, etc..), so they can get a refund when you do a terrible job (and leave you a bad review that will hunt you for years)

* If you still somehow found a client ""in the wild"", and they really wanna work with you, then WorldRemit is the easiest and fastest way to get paid, it's basicaly WesternUnion but way cheaper, and your client can pay with whatever they want, the only ""limitation"" for it is that it only works with BH (Bank d'habitat) you don't need to have a bank account, but you need to go to a BG agency and give them the transiction ID, kinda like getting a ""ماندا"" from your local post office.

* About WorldRemit, last time i used it was in 2017, and back then, despite the service being called WorldRemit in the official website, the bank agent that i dealt with (BH-Benzart) kept calling it **MoneyTrans**, so if you go there and ask about WorldRemit and they give you the usual ""nope"", make sure to ask about MoneyTrans too.

&nbsp;

**My freelancing business is getting stable income and i want to legitimize it** 

* Start a company, it doesn't cost much at all, and there is so many tax benefits for people in this line of works (assuming all of your clients are foreigners who pays in Euro/USD) 


&nbsp;


**Is there a ""Freelancer"" status in Tunisia bech n7ot'ha fi bita9et ta3rif w nodhher cool 😎?**

* No and وكيل شركة is cooler.

&nbsp;


**What are the benefits of starting a company ?? i'll be just paying taxes to this incompetent corrupt government 😠**

* It's the only way that will allow you to buy expensive things legally (car, piece of land, house, etc..)

* It's also the best and fastest way if you wanna be able to travel.

* You wont have طالب in your بطاقة تعريف  when you're clearly older than my dad...

* Extra social respect-points anywhere you go.

* Huge tax benefits if you open an international company (totalement exportatrice).

* You must do it anyway if you keep receiving ""large"" amount of money regularly (+2k/month), if you don't, it can be considered tax evasion. 

&nbsp;

**Can i send you a chat request ?** 

* unless it's an emergency and your question is VERY specific to you, i prefer that you comment here so other will benefit from it, i also hate Chat in general, so in case you still need some specific answers that for some reason you don't want them answered here, then send a direct message with all the details and i'll get back to you as soon as i can.

* TLl;DR: no chat.

#General Freelancing FAQ:

**For Programmers:**

**What should i learn**

* Whatever field you're a fan of, but the easiest one to make money with online are (in no particular order): 

* iOs and/or Android development

* Tasks Automation (bots, etc..)

* Web dev

* Game dev

* Small crossplatform apps

but don't expect to get a job ONLINE for cyber-security or some big banking software, always think about the fact that you are a total stranger to the client, so no matter how good you are, no one is gonna trust you with something worth millions of dollars *ONLINE*

&nbsp;

Also, if you are a programmer (intermediate or expert) and you're not making **at least** an extra $500 a month from side-gig as a freelancer, then you're wasting a great opportunity to make money, and you're also a total idiot and a disgrace to us programmers :) 

&nbsp;

**I am a programmer, but i don't know how to start**

* are you really ? because if by ""programmer"" you mean that you just finished 18 theoretical exams in college but have no real project at all then you are delusional, it's like calling yourself a ""writer"" simply because you graduated from ""bac lettre"", or a musician simply because you attempted to learn an instrument for one year, so at this point, you are not a programmer, you are simply a student. 

* Start making real projects, because you will NEVER get any client if you just keep learning the theory, and actually, it is a fact that most theories you learn will vanish from your skill-set if you don't practice them often enough, so the question is really simple: 

* **Can i show something to the client that will seduce them to work with me?**

* And by that i mean something along the field of the client, you can't have a portfolio full of websites, and then try to apply for a game dev job, but if you don't have a portfolio at all, then *nobody* is gonna hire you 5atrek jebt 15 fel ISET lol

* And finally, this is not at all a question related to Tunisia, beginners struggle is universal, doesn't matter if you're American or Indian, as a matter of fact, as a beginner, you have an advantage over 1st world countries because as a 20y.o from a poor/average family, a $500/month will make you feel like King Salman, but in the US this is fuck all and no one would bother with it, so use that to your advantage. 

* Google it! there is countless of reddit, youtube and various other forums post about ""getting started with freelancing"" tips, *especially* for programmers, some fields are obviously harder than other, some is hard purely because of the skill they require, and other are hard because of how saturated they are (by Indians), but it is what it is, and the whole point of this post is to show you that someone from the same background of you has made it, which mean you can make it.

&nbsp;

**For Designers:**

I don't know what should you learn, but i did hire freelance designers in the past, and the one thing i am sure of is that clients always look for ""Good final scene"", here is an example of a VERY SIMPLE 3D models but with AMAZING presentation:

* https://dribbble.com/MohChahin

And here is an example of a bad portfolio: 

* https://www.artstation.com/katisalminen

Despite the second one having models that are much more complex than the first one, I think you can all tell which one is getting more job offers.

As as a beginner designers and even intermediate/expert, keep in mind that you are gonna be working with clients who expects you to do EVERYTHING, and a well presented simple scene is way more attractive than a very technically-heavy model that looks like shit, the technical thing might be appreciated by other artists/experts, but clients who only need one job done usually never have that knowledge and only judge you as a ""casual"" person.

&nbsp;


**I don't have any Skill to sell online, am i fucked ?** 

Not really, you can always try Dropshipping, also brows /r/slavelabour  to get some ideas, but in this department usually a paypal account to receive money is crucial, so maybe try dropshipping ? (don't ask me what it is, google it), or you can bite the bullet and learn a proper skill ?

Because even if you chose dropshipping or any other e-commerce thing, the main issue is that for Skilled-Freelance the entry-fee is basically free (after aquiring the skill of course), for you however, you need a capital, to host your website, pay for good SEO, pay for Social media marketing, etc..

But it is a profitable thing nonetheless, the waiting time to make money here is also usually higher than selling your skill, so you need to be patient.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Visiting this December. What do you think of this itinerary?,"Hi everyone,

I will be visiting Tunisia for 10 days this December and the below is my itinerary. After extensive research I came to the conclusion that I will be using mostly '*louages*' to travel between a place and another. I travelled to North African countries in the past and I also know that life is usually slow paced so I'm not hassling much regarding accommodation as will be traveling during a relatively low season period. I consider myself as a slow traveller as well so won't be rushing (*as long as I'm not late for my flight lol*)

I will be landing early afternoon in Tunis airport and the plan is to get downtown, get a 'louage' and start making my way south-bound. My plan is to arrive somewhere close to Douz and explore the area of Qibili, Chott el Djerid and Tozeur. Probably I would be required to change louage at Kairouan were I wouldn't mind staying an overnight there.

When I eventually arrive at Douz area, I will dedicate 3 days to explore the area and then head north directly to Tunis were I will be spending my last 3 days there to visit Sidi Bou Said, Tunis Medina and Roman/Byzantine archaeological sites. Not interested in going to Tattoonie area and Star Wars sets. Don't think it's worth the time.

Dunno if someone can answer this but what route should I take with the louages to arrive in Douz area? Does Tunis - Kairouan - Douz make sense or I'm missing something? I'm interested in outdoor, hiking, desert, food, culture. Not interested in congested cities and luxury resorts.

Any tips are highly appreciated. Can't wait to visit the country!

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,"Tunisia Solo Female Trip Report: Budget, Highlights, Safety, Tips","Hi Tunisia! I (32F) wanted to share my solo trip experience to help future travelers. It's a long one so feel free to skip my post but I know a lot of people come here asking some questions

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,First time visiting Tunisia tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice?,"So tomorrow I’ll be travelling to Tunisia for the first time from Ireland. I have wanted to visit for a few years now but here I am. I’m staying in Hammamet on a beach hotel. Is there anything to be aware of in terms of scams and safety regarding food etc? 

In terms of money, the Tunisian Dinar is a closed currency so is it best to get some at the airport when I arrive along with a SIM card? I have also been made aware of beach vendors trying to sell you stuff on the beach. Is there any way to avoid this/make them ignore you? Is it similar to Egypt/Türkiye in terms of pushy vendors where they just leave you alone if you ignore/don’t acknowledge them?

","When shopping for souvenirs from souvenir shops without listed prices, I recommend ‘just looking’ first.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Questions ahead of visiting Sousse & Tunis for the first time,"Hi everyone!

I'm flying to Tunisia on Friday morning, with a plan of staying in Sousse (using it as a base to see El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan etc.) until Monday, then in Tunis until I fly home on Thursday night (so 6 nights in total). I've roped one of my friends into joining me for the latter four out of the six days, so I feel the pressure to have a good plan together, thus I have lots of questions before I travel...

* I see the weather this week is reaching highs of around 18-22°C in Sousse, which is positive, but on the other hand, forecasts are predicting winds of around 25mph this weekend including strong winds of up to 40mph on Friday morning before I land. How warm/cold will it likely feel? Just so I know what clothes to pack.
* Due to the last-minute nature of the trip and my strict budget, my accommodation options are a bit more limited. For my Sousse visit, it's looking like we'll have to stay in Hammam Sousse, Chott Meriam or Kantaoui...how difficult would it be travelling from each of those places to Sousse, El Djem, Mahdia, Kairouan and Monastir?
* Similarly, in what areas would it be best for us to stay in Tunis? And which areas would be complete no-nos?
* Both my outbound and return flights would be via Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport. What's the best way to get to Hammam Sousse/Chott Meriam/Kantaoui from there on a budget? And similarly, what's the best way to get back to that airport from Tunis?
* I've seen lots of travellers online recommend taking louages between places, but then I've also seen locals online say that the louage stations in Sousse and Tunis are both really unsafe, so that does worry me slightly. Perhaps someone can shed more light on this?
* I don't speak any Arabic, but I do speak reasonably good - albeit very rusty - French. Will I be able to communicate sufficiently when it comes to taxis, louages etc.?
* As a vegetarian, where (i.e. cafes, restaurants...) and what would you recommend I eat? Lots of dishes are mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17zzqo4/we_have_good_vegetarian_food/), but I don't know how readily available they are.
* Without prebooking an overpriced tour or guide, what's the best way to immerse oneself in the history and facts surrounding historical sites such as El Djem, Carthage and particular cities' medinas? Obviously all the requisite information could be found online, but it'd be good to learn and appreciate things in person too of course rather than just walking around somewhere for a bit, musing at how nice it looks and leaving.
* I appreciate that December is likely one of the quietest times to visit Tunisia - and this isn't intended to be one of the main aspects of our trip anyway - but for reference, what would people recommend in terms of nightlife for both Sousse and Tunis? 

Sorry for inundanting you all with so many questions, but any tips or advice would be much appreciated! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,gay American man with tattoos going to Tunisia,"Hey hey hey! I've been reading a lot of posts in this group anonymously. I am going to Tunisia for a week the first week of October. My impression is that, just as in any other Western or non-Western country, mindfulness, respect, and common sense are wise in Tunisia. I wanted to ask a couple of specific questions to see if anyone had any insight:  


1. Are there any members of the LGBTQ+ community who have been to Tunisia? I will not be traveling with any romantic partner and I am pretty straight-passing visually (mannerisms in some contexts might be less so). I'm planning to use common sense but I wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on this.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Tunisians! I need travel tips,"Hey folks - in just a few weeks I'll be flying from Toronto to Tunis, renting a car and driving to Sousse to stay for 2 weeks. I'm hoping some of the Tunisian Redditors can help out a Canadian visitor with travel tips.

1 - I have read that driving in Tunisia is not for the faint of heart. On a scale of 1-10 how likely am I to get in a crash between teh airport and Sousse? How likely am I to get lost?

2 - Are the paid tours worth paying for, or should we DIY an itinerary? I'm travelling with my daughter (26) and her boyfriend (27) my wife and I (mid 50's). Looking at the 3-4 day itineraries to go to Sidi Bou Said, The amphitheater (El Jeb? El Jem? I forget), Tatooine, the Sahara, etc. it seems like everything could be put together without a guide. Do you need a guide to get in these places? Am I crazy to go on our own? And once again, will I get in a wreck if I do all this driving? (We see a lot of tourists paying for guides in Canada, when they could literally walk in the places on their own, and it baffles us.)

3 - I've read that the medina/souk scene is full of aggressive people trying to force you into bad deals. Last time I shopped in a souk was in Rabat in the early 2000's (I loved it!). Should we be concerned with folks being overly aggressive? Are panhandlers a problem? How about thieves/pickpockets? (In Rabat a guy followed us around the whole time chanting anti-American slogans which was great since we are Canadian. It was pretty funny.)

4 - We all speak English and some French. I think we'll be fine language-wise, although, as with Morocco, I suspect folks will speak Arabic around us, and French/English to us. Should we be concerned with language being a problem?

Any other tips you'd share with friends coming to visit? Anything we should make sure to do while there? Anything that is clearly over-rated and we should maybe not bother with?

Shops, and public transportation will work as usual except probably from 15:00 to 20:00, taxis should be available continuously (probably less between 1800 and 2000).

Renting a car is always a good idea in Tunisia as gas is extremely cheap, Google Maps/Waze are reliable and parking is easy.

From an attire perspective I would say to not overthink about it. Most people doesn’t care, the few extremely conservatives will most likely be in neighborhoods you will not visit anyway.

Guy friends are out of question now but what about girls? 
Anytime I try to interact with girls they give me death stare. Even if I’m just sitting, minding my own business they stare with disgust in their eyes. I don’t get it. I try to smile and shit be nice but nothing.

When it comes to working it’s worse! Literally can’t find a job for myself. I would expect at least working when I have zero social life lol. I’m so bored. Do u guys have any tips of where to start or what should I look for? I mean my work experience is not bad. I’ve studied clothing design but I’ve done many different jobs. Last summer I worked for a Czech travel agency (wasn’t bad but not a cup of my tea). The season ended in September. 

Help guys pls! hhhh thanks in advance","Idk about the death stare thing, is there anything strange about your appearence? sometimes people get curious and accidently stare down someone, so it could be that.

you may want to make an effort to learn the local language if you want good friends, you don't have to become proficient at it but a minimal amount can make things better, maybe join some clubs etc...",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/zlpwrv/foreigners_living_in_tunisia_help_pls/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,What should I visit: Djerba or Sfax?,"Hi all, tourist question here 😅

I'm taking a short holiday in Tunisia for six days. I'll fly in and out of Tunis and I think that gives me enough time to visit one other place. I'm undecided between Djerba and Sfax. I would love to visit all three but it seems too complicated to travel directly between those two places.

I heard the medina in Sfax is really good, and I like that it's apparently less touristy.

The villages and culture of Djerba also sound amazing, but I'm worried that it will be full of tourist resorts and souvenir shops.

I'm interested in eating lots of good food and maybe going for a swim at the beach. I also like history and cultural sites.

I would love to hear your thoughts and would appreciate any other tips as well. Thanks!","As someone from sfax, i would say djerba for sure",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1b1hdn9/what_should_i_visit_djerba_or_sfax/,"Djerba, Sfax, Djerba, Tunis, Sfax",General,en

I am very excited to be travelling to Tunisia tomorrow and, in preparation, I'd be extremely grateful if you could help me with a few questions.

1. Does Port el Kantaoui have a louage station?  I can't seem to see one on Google Maps.
2. My arabic skill is almost non-existent.  I have a slightly better command of French.  How many people are likely to speak French?
3. What is the most reliable weather site/app for Tunisia?
4. When I arrive at the airport I will want to pick up a sim card with data so I don't rack up a big data bill on my home network.  What is the best deal for a data sim at the moment?

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Seeking advice for a 7 day trip... in December,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a guy from Singapore who will be visiting in mid-December with my brother. Currently we study in France and the UK. We both love history and archaeology (museums, material culture, visiting sites), trying new food, and meeting new people to learn and exchange information. My brother is also into wildlife photography, although I suppose December is off-season.

 Currently, we're thinking of flying into (and maybe out of?) Tunis. Unfortunately neither of us drive, but we're down to catch a bus/louage/taxi/train as needed. 

I had this itinerary in mind, but wanted to check in with the far more knowledgeable people over here if this seemed like a doable plan, or if there are improvements that could be made! 

**Day 1:** Fly into Tunis; see the Bardo Museum + Medina

**Day 2:**  Day trip to Sidi-bou-Saïd 

**Day 3:** Day trip to Carthage

**Day 4:** Day trip to Dougga 

**Day 5:** Louage (?) to Sousse, see Archaeological Museum

**Day 6:** Day trip to Kairouan 

**Day 7:** Day trip to El Jem. 

**Day 8:** Fly out of Monastir (?) 

A few questions. 

1: As you can see, we are basing ourselves in Tunis for four nights and Sousse for three - would you recommend this? 

2: Are there places to see wildlife in winter? The Ichkeul National Park looks lovely but seems out of the way, and possibly not that active in December. 

3:  What would you suggest we do in Tunis/Sousse in the evenings/nights? I'd love to check out any art centers or any interesting things that are going on. 

4: Anything food-wise that's underrated which I should try? I love the few times I've tried Tunisian food here in France, but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg.

5: What would you recommend I read or watch to learn about Tunisia? Academic books are fine, blogs are wonderful. My French is not fantastic, and neither my brother or I speak Arabic, so sadly English resources are preferable. 

Thanks in advance to everybody! I hope one day I can repay back anything I've learnt here - if you have any questions about Singapore, or England/Paris where we studied/are studying, for instance, I would be happy to have them. 

P.S. /u/scafidi_travels has produced such amazing resources! His playlists are so in-depth, but I don't have a good sense of how these fit into an itinerary where I won't rent a car. 

Don't hesitate to tell me if I'm doing anything stupid!

I only speak English and very, very basic French. Currently no travel experience in Northern Africa, but I will have been to Egypt right before this. As far as other experience in Muslim and/or Arab countries/areas I have spent a month in Turkey and time in Palestine.

If anyone has any insight as well as links for resources for reading, or recommendations/advice, I would be quite grateful. Mainly trying to get a feel for safety/comfort factor as well as ease of transportation around the country. If anyone has an tips on places to go or avoid that would be great too. I know the basics from what I have been able to read at this point, but alot of the first hand reports I have read are quite dated and speak to alot of hassling and not feeling safe alone. Also, if you have a recommendation for best SIM card to get which would have the most reliable/fast coverage.

Thanks!

Edit to add question about internet.","A couple of thing.  I'm not sure if you're from the US but if you are, make sure you enroll in the STEP program we have here.

I'm an American (Guy) here in Tunisia but this is something that should be a requirement, honestly.  This lets the Embassy know of your general whereabouts while here.  If you're from elsewhere, check out your Embassy if they have a registration program as well.

Generally, females are safe here.  I would say that you need to make sure that you use best practices.  This is a modest/Muslim country so I'd recommend not wearing anything too risque or would attract attention.  You probably won't be targeted more for your being female but more so that you're a tourist so, make sure you're on guard when out and about, just as you would anywhere else.

I've lived in Tunisia for 4 years and I've never had an issue.  My wifes sister had her phone snatched from Her but that's all I know of any sort of crime personally.  I have a co-worker who said people stole his bike but he was out late at night in a neighborhood he shouldn't have been in.  Again, use safe practices while out.

If you would like a local contact, I can be one.  They're good to have.  My wife is Tunisia and speaks English really well.  We both work at the US Embassy here so, we could try to help as best as we could.

As far as best SIM card, I've had Orange for a while now and I like them.  Wife uses Orange too.  TunisiaTelecom I would avoid like the plague.

I'm open to different modes of transportation, such as private cars, taxis, or any other options that will get me there quickly. I'm also curious about the approximate cost and travel time for each option.

If anyone has any recommendations or tips for me, I'd really appreciate it!   
Thank you in advance for your help.","Taxi to moncef Bey - Louage station --> ask which is nearest to full: Louage to Monastir or to Sousse.

Each car takes 8 people and they depart as soon as the 8th person is there (no time schedule, only dependent on getting the 8th person).

Sousse is bigger than monastir so traffic to sousse is more frequent and it's only 25km away from Monastir so if for example Louage to sousse has 6 people (you're 7th) and the one to Monastir has less than 6 so go to Sousse. for Sousse - Monastir just take another louage (same station) they are super frequent and you will be in Monastir in Monastir 30mn max after departure from Sousse.

You can always not go for the extra step and get ticket to Monastir in Moncef bey, but if you're first or second in the car you could wait there for god knows how long.

as I said there is no schedule and the only condition for departure of louage is: the driver must get his 8 seats sold.

The second question is about the time one should spend in Tunisia. How much time is enough to get a general feel of the country. Is a week (including flights) enough or is a week not enough.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Tunisia as a tourist,"Hi all, it's my first time in Tunisia. After visiting Morocco earlier in the year and loving it, I thought I would give Tunisia a go. Our journey began in La Marsa, Tunis (which we loved), the people seemed nice, the beach was lovely & things generally surprised me as I was expecting a lot more poverty (hope nobody takes offence to this). We moved on to Tunis, which was also amazing. So much culture and the vibe was right. However, we've now made our further south to Hammamet and Sousse. And I have a few bones to pick... 



Tourism seems to be confined to resorts/all-inc package holidays. There's a kind of apartheid vibe, where the private beaches are clean & the public beaches are often left as an afterthought, with them being riddled with rubbish, plastic, graffiti and close to no amenities. A big chunk of the resort-tourist demographic seems to feel above the locals in a sense. There's a really colonial vibe around this. As someone who is staying exclusively in private rentals (I don't believe in staying in chain hotels/resorts), I feel that not a lot is tailored or accessible to my kind of traveller. I.e in Hammamet Sud, we had to walk 50 minutes down the beach until we found some parasols to rent for the day, as we were refused service as most were owned by private beach/resorts. We are now in Hammam Sousse, staying in a private rental & are experiencing the exact same thing.

 

We are also finding the locals are a lot ruder in Hammamet / Sousse. Perhaps this is due to their relationship with low-quality tourism? As a couple that isn't staying in a resort, we're finding it extremely difficult to do basic things, such as eating out or sunbathing on a clean beach. The local beaches seem to be filled with rubbish and plastic, with no options to rent parasols and all the beach bars and facilities are restricted to resorts. It's a shame, as we'd rather spend time around the locals & immerse ourselves in their culture, but it seems even the locals (unless wealthy) are shunned from spaces in their own country.

Any insights on my words would be great.","Spot on, 

OP i totally understand what type of immersive experience you’re looking for and i have to say that in morocco you can have that as a solo traveler simply because its much easier to navigate and the tourism involves a lot of local culture and landmarks,

This is not the case in tunisia, there’s three tunisias

One for the tourists
One for the “normals”
One for the expat tunisians that only come a few times a year

If you want to have a good experience id recommend finding a tunisian + X country that is well off enough but also still has connections on the tunisian soil so you can actually find what you are looking for.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Living in Tunisia for a couple months?,"[20F] 3aslema! I’m graduating at the end of 2024 and considering going back to Tunisia for a few months before starting grad school. I’m originally half Moroccan half tunisian but only lived in Tunisia for like 3 years when I was like 9 before coming to the US. I felt super disconnected from both cultures. This is why last year I studied in Rabat Morocco for a semester and it was so so so fulfilling. I went to Tunisia as well in the summer but every time I go it’s with my dad and I don’t really get to do much, idk people my age and I don’t really know much about any cities outside of where our house is (which is secluded and surrounded by olive trees so nothing to do).

Anyways, I’m considering spending a few months (4-6 months) on my own traveling around Tunisia in 2025 and just looking for advice on the things I should consider. One of my biggest challenges in Morocco was I would limit myself from doing things out of embarrassment because my Darija is rusty. My Tunisian is also rusty :/

Pls give me any and all advice. Like where should I stay? How to meet friends? What should I think about or consider before? Idek where to start but I want to make this happen.","I really appreciate that you want to discover more about your roots. It's going to be an exceptional experience. Don't be shy about your accent; it will be the opposite. It will be a nice way for other people to ask you where you lived before and to hear your story. Moreover, Tunisian people are generally friendly; however, don't trust anyone and stay vigilant, especially in cities. I recommend you visit Tunis (including Sidibousaid, Marsa, Lac, downtown, and Mdina), Hammamet, Sousse, and Monastir. As you're traveling solo, if you can find an organized tour to the south, it will be perfect.

Tunisia,travel tips for Tunisia,Tunisia to Genoa,"I'm university student and I want to spend my vacation in genova with my Italian friend  for 3-5 days 
Is it necessary to get visa or not? If so how to get one and how much does it cost? 
Which is better going by ferry or plane? 
And what's the minimum budget I should have considering my friend is hosting me in his home? 
And what are the steps and tips  I should do knowing that it's my first time travelling alone? 

","If you only have a Tunisian passport, you'll need a visa for Italy, and most other countries in the world. It'll cost around 300tnd. Here for more info: [Demander un visa – Ambasciata d'Italia Tunisi (esteri.it)](https://ambtunisi.esteri.it/fr/servizi-consolari-e-visti/servizi-per-il-cittadino-straniero/visti/chiedere-un-visto/)

What do you mean what is better? Like cheaper, faster, more convenient? It's up to the dates you choose, and your own judgement.

Italy isn't very expensive, and since your friend will host you you'll just need some pocket money for public transport and eating out, so around 20€ to 50€ per day.

And as final advice, you could have found the answer to all of your questions very easily if you just used google or took a breath and thought for a few secs, I know it can be overwhelming, but you'll have to think for yourself a lot to plan for this trip, so better start now.

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,Is Tunisia safe for female tourists?,"As the title says: is Tunisia safe for tourists. I, my sister and a friend will be going to Tunisia in June and was wondering what it is like for tourists, but specifically for female tourists as we are all females. Is it okay to walk around alone/ use public transport? Or should we take private transportation?

‼️Btw we are black‼️

Update:

Sorry it’s been a while since I’ve posted, I was meant to post an update but I was super busy. So I would say it was safe and we had a very nice time. Majority of the time we stayed in the resort, where we did take taxi to most places. 

There was a time we did travel to another city and stayed in an airbnb. I would recommend taking a public taxi, as it really saves on costs then hiring a full private taxi. We were in this city for about 2 days and we went around at night, which was quite busy and we felt quite safe. 

There was only this one time that when we were in a taxi and the police stopped us and asked for our passports. Unfortunately I had left mine in the resort but my sister and my friend had theirs. The police asked us a few questions like where we were staying and why we came etc. After that we went on our way. It wasn’t a very scary encounter but the taxi driver did mention that doesn’t usually happen so I’m assuming since we are black he may have assumed we were immigrants. 

We also experienced a few remarks/heckles from strangers but majority of the time it was fine. It’s definitely a place I would recommend to go on holiday :).","I traveled there alone last month and it was really safe, people are LOVELY, it was Ramadan and I used to go to this really nice simple restaurant and the staff there took really good care of me, I was going through the most difficult times in my life when I was there and I felt at home, forever grateful for Tunis for treating me so nicely, I must add that I'm a bit older so maybe that's why I was never harassed maybe a young woman would have a different experience",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1cmjzo9/is_tunisia_safe_for_female_tourists/,"Tunis, Tunis",Safety,en

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,Tunisia and the absurd car dependency,"As you can figure out from my username, I really don’t like cars. I think they are a very inefficient  and polluting mean of transportation that was pushed to us through a concentrated lobbying effort and our cities have been destroyed to accommodate their wasteful existence.

I think they are a symptom of the new tendency of people to become more individualistic and inward going and it makes our societies more apathetic and egoistical. It offers a controlled environment that allow people to ignore the impending climate  and the societal issues like poverty.

Cars are a very non democratic way of organising our transport as it excludes all people who cannot afford or drive a car.

We are diverting so much resources into the of roads and building bridges. These moneys could have been used for more public transportation means.

Cars are dangerous and they are the cause of so many road kills and ruined lives. The car fumes are also one of the biggest cause of avoidable deaths.
Cars are loud and they make our cities worse to live in.

Now, dear Tunisian redditors, with all this said, why are we still so dependant on cars and why everyone I talk to seems to drool on the thought of having a car. What made us so addicted to the car?","Our urban planning is terrible. 
- Most people barely can afford a car or simply can't. 
- We import 99% of the cars and maybe 95% of the fuel
- We subsidize fuel.
- We pay for maintaining the road quality (which we are doing a terrible job at)

Point is it costs a lot of money that we do not have and in 80% of the cases it s unnecessary.

Of course, we need cars for medical urgencies, eldery transportation, when there are 4 people travelling in a car.

But, we should always provide alternatives for the cases where 1 person has to travel alone in a car because it s inefficient.

Bike use is an easy and fast solution.
It worked for the Netherlands with tinier streets than ours so there is no reason it would not work for us.

For that we need bike lanes and protection. For e.g., in Ariana it is technically possible to use the bike within the neighbourhood but once you have to cross under a bridge it becomes very dangerous (for e.g. the bridge between Ariana and Menzah 1).

Biking also help mantain health and reduce diabetes and heart issues within society and therefore less stress on healthcare system.

Of course Bikes are not enough and that s why we need an efficient public transport. Of course the RFR project is a big plus.
However, it s only in the capital. (Which is another big topic). 

But even in Tunis, the system is not and will not be adequate for the size of the city: So far all routes lead to the city center (which is the approach used for medium sized cities in europe). It should be possible to take public transport from for e.g. La goulette to el Mourouj without having to have a stopover in Downtown.

But given that one line of train/tram costs a lot and takes forever. Buses are the best solution for now. But we have to have imo 2 type of buses express one and local ones.

The express buses should have a seperate lane ( even if it means that certain streets have to be bus and resident use only ) to ensure that it is on time. The local buses can be dealt with later. And ffs, put a fucking piece of paper on each bus stop to say the ""expected arrival time"" and in big bus stops put a LED display with actual arrival time.

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,Why most Tunisian here following blindly the west without checking facts?,"*I am sure some people won't even discuss this topic and just follow the clan 'west' and will downvote this but still i want to discuss this with facts with people who are open enough. A noticed here that a lot  just follow the west thinking it's the best for Tunisia, and our country is* s*hifting towards the east and it's 'Bad', we will be isolated, we will regress , china is not a democracy etc.*

# Let me get it straight with facts that you can look it up:

# 1- The Age of the Amazing West:

I will now say if any ruling system is good or bad. In fact, every system worked at some point till it failed.  
From egyptian monarchy to Spainsh kingdom, To the Mangolian empire, The Roman empire, The shogun area in japan and the democracy in the USA.  
None here can argue that at some point each one of those where one of the biggest successful empires in their own Era. Yet not all of them were democracy. Every system has it's pros and cons so it won't be wise to follow blindly a system saying it's the **One.** Just like any other methodoly or systems in the world, everything is evolving and what we are seeing now we can also assume that we will be facing a new change in the world.

Indeed the USA and the west, especially after the WWII led the world, economically, technologically and politically. As several countries looked up for them as a sign of success, Countries tried to implement their systems and their way of life. After all it's working their, USA was thriving so was Western germany, Uk, Canada etc..

Keep in mind that at that period. As a sign of the success of the USA in the 20th century. the Empire state building has been built in just 1 year. The middle class was also capable of having a house a car etc.. so it was in other western countries.

# 2- The 21st century crash:

However, in the start of the 21th century specifically after the 2008 crash. Countries and economist were wondering if the economical system is still intact. And the growth in the west started to slow down due also to the huge growth from countries like China, India, Russia and other countries in south east Asia and Latin America. That also impacted the market shares for classical industrial countries like France. Also due to the cheap products provided by china, USA was not capable anymore to compete with them, thus started to become more hostile and pushed towards the sanctions. The sanctions worked a bit since the world economy is backed bby the $, knowing that before that, the world economy actually was backed by Gold( it's a long story to explain the reason you can google it). That made the USA capable on printing money and also made other countries trust less the $.

In the meantime, even for global issues, the main decision were always defined by the G7 ( the same winners after WWII) Yet we all know that economy and the world is evolving, the top 5 countries now cannot stay the same top 5 forever. And we already saw this especially after 2020. Europe now is facing a huge growth issue with France has 0.7% this year, uk 0.6% and germany a bit more than 1%. Compared to 4% in China and 6% in India. The econmocial projections already estimate that The top 10 countries in the world in 2040 won't be even european almost. As India, Brasil, SA, Malysia are growing exponentially. And india is projected to be the 3rd already surpassing Germany and Japan in 2030.

# 3- The New Players in the Game:

Other countries actually started to follow the BRICS as they know that sadly, if their trading is backed by the dollar then USA will have always the leverge and power to sanction them. As the $ now is not onnly used for it's main goal ( to have 1 global trading currency) but also as a leverge from the USA to weaker and more economically fragile countries.

Countries like El Selvador with their new president that reduced his countries crime rate by 80% ( with harsh means , you can google that) yet western countries tried to sanction him because the 'human right' is not respected with drug lords. Now also is thinking to shift ( if it didn't already).

Countries also like Ethipia sees that the USA is now struggling to maintain their own infrastructure, they even struggled in building a 600 meters railways in california , how will they invest in our infrastructure in Africa? in the other hand china's infracture is one of the best in the world and helped them to grow more than 5% on average in the last 5 years.

# 4- Conclusion

I am not saying that we should take any side, but if you consider yourself 'open minded' then you need to check the fact, and be open that there are other ways and systems that can work till they don't at a certain point of time and that as Tunisia, it's wise to adapt quickly to those changes and not follow the west or the east just because they are 'cool' or based on what you watch on TVs. if you check philadelphia zombies on youtube about whole regions in the usa with drug addicts and people can't take public transport you will know that the USA is not as what it was 50 years ago.

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,My thoughts on Canada as someone who has lived there for almost a decade,"There’s a lot of confusion about Canada as it’s becoming super popular right now (because of increased immigration targets), so I figured I’d clear up some confusion as someone who lived in Canada for almost a decade and know different provinces.

There’s a lot of stuff I want to tell people if they ask me for advice about moving to Canada but I refrain from saying everything because they want to hear what they like to hear otherwise they think I somehow have something against them personally.. so this is going to sound blunt but in my opinion it’s the unfiltered truth

# Canada is two countries dressed up as one

Canada has a federal system, meaning that every province in Canada controls a subset of areas, most notably things around rent/healthcare/schooling so things vary wildly between provinces including even taxes. There’s 4 main provinces where most Canadians live: Ontario (38% of population, 38% of GDP/economy), Quebec (22% of population, 20% of GDP), British Columbia (13% of population, 14% of GDP), Alberta (11% of population, 15% of GDP). However, most provinces are similar and create laws that are close to each other to make things smoother. For example, nearly all provinces have 19 as the drinking age, the same maximum interest rate you can charge…etc 

Quebec, however, is so different from the rest it can almost be its own country. It’s the only province allowed to collect its own taxes, run its own retirement program, control its own immigration. It’s also the only majority French speaking province and has very specific laws about this because they care a lot about French. It even has a different approach to housing making housing much cheaper in Quebec than anywhere in Canada (for example rent in Montreal which is one of Canada’s biggest cities is much cheaper than even small cities in Ontario not even Toronto) but Quebec also has higher taxes for the average person (and not much different for high incomers).

Quebec generally has lower economic opporurtinities compared to the other provinces (mostly due to it isolating itself with French) and pays lower salaries on higher average taxes. At the same time, it’s cheaper than the other main provinces in almost all aspects but especially in housing (Alberta being a bit similar there). 

Now onto more controversial things, Quebecois have their own distinct culture and history to the point that Quebec wanted to leave Canada which they almost did a couple of times. If you ever visit Quebec and another province, you'll notice immediately that they feel like different countries from laws to architecture to people's attitudes. While Alberta is the most right wing province, Quebec is by far the most racist and especially when it comes to muslims. It's more similar to France in this aspect (so trying to ban hijab, they even protested a muslim/maghrebi neighborhood…etc) while the rest of Canada, even Alberta, is much more accepting and is closer to the stereotypical image people have of a Canadian. Moreover, most people in the rest of Canada have not even heard of Tunisia (and sometimes Algeria). 

So when people talk about Canada, they should specify what province they’re talking about but much much more importantly Quebec or Rest of Canada, especially that up to 95% of Tunisians live in Quebec the last time I checked stats. Also, I’ll talk mostly about the rest of Canada because while I know Quebec quite well, I have never lived in it for more than 2 months. 

# Why are recent immigrants often unhappy

This is very subjective but based on my own observations. Immigraiton in Canada has shifted significantly, the federal government increased its immigraiton targets insanely (accepting 1m people a year for a country of 40m when it used to be 200-300k/yr). People come to Canada with very high expectations, they hear about healthcare, social and public services, the reputation of a high standard of living…etc and the reality ends up being different but people are shocked to see that because while they hear these stories about Italy/France, they don't know about Canada.

This happens because of many reasons

# Cost of living doesn’t match salaries 

With the surge of immigrants but no increase in housing built, housing costs have soared. You have to pay $3000/mo for a 1bd in Toronto right now. So did demand on a lot of stuff, not to mention the soaring prices across the world. People basically underestimate how much it takes to live in a big city in Canada.

Also, salaries are higher on average in Canada than most of the EU and of course way higher than Tunisia so people accept offers not knowing what kind of standard of living it will get them. Moreover, the kind of super fast immigraiton growth in Canada is not done in proportion with high paying jobs in Canada, so in other words Canada is bringing in immigrants mostly to work jobs that Canadians don’t want or work jobs that Canadians want but not at a salary Canadians would accept. 

Canadian companies also value Canadian experience and degrees and will pay you less or won’t hire you if you don’t have it. This is the case everywhere but especially true for Canada and is a well documented problem. People don’t have this problem nearly as much in the US or also to a lesser degree in the EU. Most people coming here will be underemployed (not unemployed, but working jobs they’re overqualified or underpaid for). This is hard to understand for immigrants coming to Canada because they compare it to countries with lower cost of living, it’s also why I hear that salaries in Canada are not that high compared to France…etc when in reality they are, it’s just that they’re high for people with Canadian degrees and experience. 

# Healthcare

Healthcare is free in Canada but it’s not easily available. You can wait for a year to find a family doctor and going to the ER for an emergency you can wait for 5 hours+. This is despite Canada spending insane amounts on healthcare, much more than Europe but the result is worse. I personally decided to fly to Tunisia next time I need something like a minor surgery.

# Taxes

Taxes are low compared to EU for the average person in Canada but they’re incredibly high for high incomers. It goes up to 55% marginal tax (i.e. what you pay for every extra dollar you earn). Being successful in Canada means you get destroyed by taxes while social services are not at the same level you’d find in high tax countries like Norway or Sweden. 

# Housing

Besides rent which I discussed, buying a house or apartment in most of Canada has become impossible. My salary is in the top 1% but it's not enough to buy the average house in Canada let alone in expensive cities in Canada. This is because housing prices soared in the last 10 years, making a lot of people who own a house much richer and creating a problem with housing affordability including higher rent.

# Would you recommend Canada? 

It depends on a million factors but to me, unless you can move to the US, Canada makes sense compared to EU if and only if you get a well paying job. Compared to staying in Tunisia, there's very few scenarios where I'd recommend not moving.

Canada is probably the best country to be in for someone looking for an average life (even compared to the US), taxes are low and the standard of living is pretty good compared to France/Italy/Spain minus the healthcare issue. 

If you want to move here on a below average salary or if you’re a very high income earner (200k+), Canada is a bad deal. On a below average salary, you’ll struggle with the basic necessities because they’re expensive here (rent, transportation, food). On a high income, you’ll pay insane taxes and won’t get much in return for it.

Finally, I hope this comes across as a balanced overview because trust me I’m not trying to push any agenda here. For example, I can’t own a house despite having a very high salary but it doesn’t mean I’m not living very comfortably and can afford anything I want and have savings. It also doesn’t mean I’m not unhappy with many things. I’m still recommending Canada for certain people even though I’m planning to leave to the US. It’s just that there’s a lot of nuance involved and I think the hardest thing to grasp for people when it comes to Canada is that it’s different from both EU and US so people who try to think of it from either perspective end up missing the mark.",Lived in Canada for 6 years (3 years in AB and 3 years in QC) and this is the MOST accurate description of Canada,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/15sxsf4/my_thoughts_on_canada_as_someone_who_has_lived/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,There is no social ladder in Tunisia ,"The system created in Tunisia makes that poor people stay poor forever… there is no social ladder in this country, people who made it somehow long time ago stay wealthy forever, it’s not like in the us for example with its dynamic economy where a lot of wealthy people lose their money by the second and the third generation, in this fucked up system you meet some of the dumbest people of the world and they actually are one of the kroz…

You’re only chance of making it in Tunisia is to leave the country, don’t believe the fake success stories of Boumiza mtaa l 3sal and co, there is always some hidden ‘little details’ like ‘my father gave me 300 malyoun to start my business’.

Those guys actually think they started from sfer and they don’t even know what sfer is, sfer for real struggling Tunisians is having a take shitty overcrowded public transportation every day, get through public school and make it against all odds, find a job without m3aref ( good luck doing that as a junior, don’t forget to include your useless diplomas in your resume )… 

Good luck to all the struggling people trying to get out of the real sfer, the system there makes it that those useless kroz stay there forever, and the rest of the population is destined to literally live as modern slaves, and they really hate it when you escape that destiny by leaving the country altogether, that would be my advice to anyone who wants to become someone and actually enjoy life.","It’s probably harder than elsewhere but hopefully still existant.


The system indeed protects existing wealth, by unfair benefits. There are multiple success stories (from zero to decent wealth), the success stories doesn’t need to show off to be known.

Keep in mind, not everyone have entrepreneurial skills (I don’t have them), but anyone knows lot of people that succeeded. Again Success is not to be confused with fame. 95% of successful businessmen/women are unknown to the public. And we all know lot of examples of people that made their way up to gain wealth.


Also do not expect someone to become millionaire in on night or couple of months, it’s usually a multi-year work.
Even the wealthiest hairs that you mention, took years not to say decades to build their wealth.


In short, if you have the skills, the strength, the perseverance, you can build a very decent wealth. Not talking about you, but only losers try to find excuses.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1f3wv1f/there_is_no_social_ladder_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

My idea was to book a tour through Getyourguide or Viator since it's very convenient in terms of how to handle the transportation but I'm finding out that here they ask for a minimum of 2 people. I actually had booked a tour for El Djem + Kariouan but they cancelled it since it's just 1 person... oh, and also the fact that if I try to book for 1 person the price skyrockets to more than 200€ is crazy...

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,First impression of Tunisia… from an outsider.,"I’m Indonesian, and I just visited Tunisia at the end of last year (which was one week ago) to visit my boyfriend’s family. Tunisia is very beautiful. The coastline? Breathtaking. The hills around Tunis that you can see from the Highway? Beautiful. The food? Amazing. The seafood? SCRUMPTIOUS. Here are some positive things I really loved:

1. People are extremely friendly:
We went to the market and bought some stuff for New Year’s Eve. At the butcher, the man asked me where I’m from and he said welcome. The fruit-veggie seller said welcome and even wanted to give me the veggies for free (I rejected, of course). The guy at the Bourguiba Museum said welcome and told me that it’s fascinating that Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. People are so friendly!
2. Amazing food scene:
I am Indonesian - I love spicy food! I think I’ve been eating so much. I love the seafood, it’s so fresh and reminds me of home. I love the sweets. The portions are also huge - this part is when my boyfriend steps in and would help finish my food!
3. Great entertainment:
Coffee shops, bars, all these things are important for me. I love how it’s very open. So much music, dancing - or even just to hang out and talk with your friends. It’s very nice to see these places all lively and crowded, especially on weekends.
4. Rich culture and history:
I went to the Museum in Bardo and in Sousse. Both museums are amazing. So much history, and as a history nerd, I was so delighted to see that they are preserved. These are the things that Tunisia, as a country, needs to protect as Tunisia has thousands of years of rich history. The guide we had in Bardo was super nice and gave us a thorough explanation on Tunisian history. 

But, here are some negative things I noticed:
1. Lack of public transportation:
See, as an Indonesian, I can’t really criticize Tunisia on this, but considering the fact that Tunisia is rather small compared to Indonesia, I think the country can do so much better.
I took the SNCFT from Sousse to Tunis. The train arrived (30 mins late), I cannot help but notice that the trains are very similar to what we used to have before a massive transformation around a decade ago.
The Tunis-Carthage airport is also chaotic. I really love the architecture inside, I find it very original, but I find it too chaotic - too many staffs, they change gates without prior notification, etc. 
This lack of public transport is then added up by another issue, which is the fact that cars are heavily taxed. My boyfriend’s mom thought that I am very rich because I have my own car in Indonesia. I am not. When I heard that my tiny, €6.5k car costs almost €8.5k in Tunisia, I was shook. How are people supposed to transport themselves if cars are very expensive but yet public transport is severely lacking?
2. Lack of digitalization:
When I asked my boyfriend if we could buy the train tickets online, he laughed. I also had to stick to cash - I’ve never handled cash, ever. In Indonesia, we pay with bank apps and e-wallet apps by scanning QR Codes. In Tunis, my card got declined 3 times - there was not even a notification that the transaction failed, which means that the card machine didn’t even work.

Negative sides aside, I had an amazing time in Tunisia. Will definitely re-visit sometime in the Summer! 3aychek!","I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip, and we hope you come visit us again.  
Yes, we have been suffering from public transportation for decades, and no one has yet found a solution (this includes the bus, the train, the metro and even Tunisair flights-planes).

However, using cards to pay is not yet a culture here, you can say that all Tunisians must have cash to shop comfortably, but we are getting better day by day (but slowly), we mostly use cards to extract cash from ATM.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1913psr/first_impression_of_tunisia_from_an_outsider/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage",General,en
Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,Thoughts about tunisian Diwena,"My friend recently sold his FCR, and he told me about the shocking corruption he encountered. He said there are many corrupt customs agents, and you can get things done if you pay them.

I also know a transporter who takes goods from Tunisia to France. He has to pay around 2,000 TND in bribes every time to avoid inspections that would waste his time.

What's frustrating is that, unlike our neighboring countries, we're the only ones with this FCR law. It seems like they don't want to change it, allowing customs officials to keep making money from these bribes.

It's not just customs; it seems like this corruption problem exists in many departments.

How you prepare for an outage of the water supply through water bottles?

As I was in tunisia as tourist visiting the family, I saw the big problem already coming, without petrol, no trucks can transport and distribute the huge amounts of water bottles in the whole country.

I made water test stripe measurements in Sousse and Kasserine, while Sousse is chemically just not good, in Kasserine, there is lead (cause brain damage and cause issues in brain development of children) and other toxic minerals contaminating the water.

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,We need to change things in our economy or we will keep facing always the same problems.,"Hey everyone, I want to talk about what's happening in Tunisia. Our main issues stem from a struggling economy and weak currency, causing low salaries, like a minimum wage of 390 for a 40-hour week and 460 for a 48-hour week. To boost salaries, we should stop state subsidies on things like bread and sugar (except maybe oil, which makes a profit) but it still doesn't make sense for someone with a 300K car or living abroad to pay the same as someone with a Peugeot 206.

We also need to fix our deficit-ridden public companies. Many have more employees than necessary. We could expand their functions to make them more productive, or we might have to let go of some employees to cut costs and make profits. Another option is privatizing non-essential companies, like those producing cigarettes, which are in the red and costing the state money, by privitazing them the state will make money off taxes.

If we make our public companies profitable, the government will have more money. This could lead to reducing taxes, which I believe is a major cause of our current inflation. I'm proposing we follow a socio-democratic model like many European countries, with free education, healthcare, and public transport. Instead of subsidies for everyone, let's provide direct social aid to families in need.

But to make these changes, we need a bold leader at the helm, not a bunch of fools. It'll take time, but if we don't act now to change our economic structure, by voting to the right people we'll keep facing the same problems.

Tunisia,transportation in Tunisia,Suggestions for a working itinerary for a trip to Tunis,"Hello. I'm looking for some suggestions/comments on my tentative itinerary for an 8 day trip I will be taking to Tunisia in about 2 months. I won’t be renting a car and will rely on taxis,  louages and possibly one internal r/t flight

I will start with 2 ½ days in Tunis and check out the main attractions there (Carthage, Medina, Sidi Bou Said, Zitouna Mosque and just do a lot of exploration of the city)

I also want to have some beach time (two days) and I cannot decide between taking a flight to Djerba or taking land transportation Hammamet. I am leaning towards Djerba as the descriptions of that spot sound nicer and maybe less touristy as Hammamet.  

Seeing  the amphitheater  El Jem is VERY high on my priorities. Would it make sense taking a long day trip from Tunis?  Should I stay for 1-2 day in Sousse and go from there?

Hello everyone!

My name is Mohammed from Saudi Arabia, and I'm planning to visit Tunisia for the first time at the end of May. I couldn't find a similar question in the subreddit, so I thought I'd ask for some advice. 😅

I'm a solo traveler looking to experience the best of Tunisia in just 4 days. My current plan includes visiting the following locations:

1. Medina
2. Carthage
3. Hammamet
4. Kairouan
5. El Jem
6. Matmata

I have a couple of questions for you guys:

1. Are these locations truly the best that Tunisia has to offer? If not, are there any other must-see places I should consider?

2. Is renting a car essential for this trip, or is there a reliable public transportation system I can use to travel between these locations?

I decided to post here since it's the best place to ask about Tunisia. We have booked our first international holiday in Hammamet and I'm a preparation freak so I'd want to ask about a few things.

1. How is the public transport working in Hammamet area? Are there any buses or trains so we can travel around the region? Our local govt recommends using SNTRI buses but I cannot find any information nor timetables for these lines. We'd like to travel Yasmin Hammamet -> Hammamet -> Nabeul.   
Alternatively we are considering taking a taxi, but how high are the fares nowadays? How do I catch/order the taxi? Is it possible to communicate with drivers in ENG or rather in French or Arabic?  
Furthermore, does Google Maps work well in Hammamet? Or is it better to stick to local maps and just ask in the hotel for directions?
2. How can we recognise tourist traps? I'd love to try real tunisian cuisine, but I'm afraid that there's gonna be a lot of places catered especially to tourists since we are visiting a resort city.
3. What can you recommend to visit in Hammamet area? I know that there are WWII historical places and that Nabeul is known for ceramics.
4. How safe is Hammamet? Are there any place in particular that we shouldn't visit?
5. I'd be very thankful for any cultural/behavioral advices so we are not ignorant while visiting 🫶

I actually had booked a tour for El Djem + Kariouan but they cancelled it since it's just 1 person... oh, and also the fact that if I try to book for 1 person the price skyrockets to more than 200€ is crazy...

I’m staying in Tunisia for 5 days and need some advice on which city I should stay in. My flight lands in Tunis-Carthage international airport. I did some research and most people are recommending to stay in Sidi Bou Said but I’m not sure. I want to see historical sites and experience the authentic beauty of Tunisian food and culture. I don’t care much for resorts. I would really appreciate recommendations.","I would advice you to stay in Marsa yes, a very good advice. It’s a very pleasant “suburb” right at the beach, you are very safe there being a tourist and it will give you French Cote D’Azur vibes, very Mediterranean in the summer, lots of cafes and places to eat and alot of people outside till late at night due to the summer. 

From there u can move around by taxi. But as said u need to be aware of scammers. If u have traveled frequently before outside of the West you have some experience. If u speak some French that always helps. 
Don’t trust people who approach you, whatever they tell u etc. Anyone approaching u to try and stay in touch with u whether that’s by being “extremely helpful” or “too spontaneous”….avoid the MOFO. 

Carthage is a place of Roman ruins of course. Beautiful suburb of Tunis and close to Sidi Bou Said and Marsa. So easy to visit. Sidi Bou Said is well known and nice to visit, also has a small beach in the center where u can go for a swim. These three places are the better neighbourhoods/suburbs of Tunis. LAC 1 or 2 u have some nice places to go out for a drink at night. And then u also have Tunis the city center and all surrounding neighborhoods as well, not directly at the sea. There u need to know which place to go to. The Medina is in the city center and it’s big, old where u can taste the sphere of old times, lots of hidden cafes, restaurants and other places. Tiny pathways. However also where u will come across a lot of annoying locals trying to sell u as a tourist their stuff. 
A good advice is to always wear your sunglasses. No eye contact makes things easier. Especially in the Medina.

Since it hot as fuck remember that generally no sane Tunisian is going to wander around in the bright sun between daytime 12 and 16 o’clock. So don’t expect a lot if u visit the Medina around that time. Either go early meaning your there at 8 in the morning or late in the afternoon meaning at earliest around 5pm.

Edit to add question about internet.","A couple of thing.  I'm not sure if you're from the US but if you are, make sure you enroll in the STEP program we have here.

I'm an American (Guy) here in Tunisia but this is something that should be a requirement, honestly.  This lets the Embassy know of your general whereabouts while here.  If you're from elsewhere, check out your Embassy if they have a registration program as well.

Generally, females are safe here.  I would say that you need to make sure that you use best practices.  This is a modest/Muslim country so I'd recommend not wearing anything too risque or would attract attention.  You probably won't be targeted more for your being female but more so that you're a tourist so, make sure you're on guard when out and about, just as you would anywhere else.

I have a co-worker who said people stole his bike but he was out late at night in a neighborhood he shouldn't have been in.  Again, use safe practices while out.

If you would like a local contact, I can be one.  They're good to have.  My wife is Tunisia and speaks English really well.  We both work at the US Embassy here so, we could try to help as best as we could.

As far as best SIM card, I've had Orange for a while now and I like them.  Wife uses Orange too.  TunisiaTelecom I would avoid like the plague.  Ooredoo I'm not a huge fan of but that's just customer service side that I had issues with them.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9ric3v/solo_female_travel_to_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,it
Tunisia,solo travel in Tunisia,Where to stay in the Tunis area for a solo traveller?,"Hi, I'm a solo traveller who is heading to Tunisia for 7-10 days in January. I plan to spend my time around the extended Tunis area. Do you have recommendations on which neighbourhoods or towns to stay in (La Marsa, Sidi Bou Said, Medina, Carthage, Hammamet, etc.)?

I was thinking of spending the 1st half in Tunis Center/Medina and then spending the 2nd half up in a scenic part of the area.

I do enjoy exploring a city's nightlife and meeting locals & fellow travellers.

I will be working remotely so I will need reliable access to internet (or a coworking space).

Tunisia,solo travel in Tunisia,Solo tourist in Tunisia,"Hey everyone,  just wondering if I am planning a solo visit to Tunisia possibly sometime ranging from October to December, I wanted to ask about the following: 

1. How is the Political situation right now? Is the country tourist safe or is it like 2011?
2. The spread of the delta variant, is it now under control? I am now fully vaccinated.
3. What is the ideal time duration to spend in Tunisia?
4.Is UBER available in Tunisia or do I have to take the local taxi and if so do I need to agree on a price or is there a meter?  Are taxis readily available throughout the country?
5. Are all vendors supporting credit cards or do I need to carry cash with me everywhere?
6. Any recommendations on what places are a must go to and what to watch out for or avoid?

Sorry for asking so many questions but Tunisia is a very beautiful country with a lot of nature and culture that I aim to experience soon.

Thanks in advance guys =))","1-Political situation is chaotic but the country is safe, even in 2011 it was kinda safe btw. Of course avoid bad neighborhoods like everywhere else and you are totally fine, police is everywhere in Tunisia. 

2-Not yet fully under control

3-it‘s up to you there is no ideal duration but i‘ll say 2 weeks. If you are only planning to go to the beach 1 week is enough.
No Uber but Bolt (and others), very similar and works perfectly fine. Taxis are everywhere and there is a meter.

4-No bring cash everywhere.

5- depends on what you are interested in (beaches,mountains,sahara desert,historical sites..?) i‘d say SidiBouSaid,Tunis medina,Dougga ruins,Tozeur and north suburb of Tunis in general for nice evenings are a must. Star wars blabla and mass tourism lowcost destinations like Sousse is a no go for me. Djerba is also overated if you ask me.

I would not consider visiting places deemed dangerous by my government if I didn't think there was a possibility that the advice is wrong. I have no intention of disrespecting Tunisia or Tunisians.

Tunisia,solo travel in Tunisia,"Tunisia Solo Female Trip Report: Budget, Highlights, Safety, Tips","Hi Tunisia! I (32F) wanted to share my solo trip experience to help future travelers. It's a long one so feel free to skip my post but I know a lot of people come here asking some questions

# Basics

* **Origin**: USA via Air France
* **Visa**: None required
* **Cash**: Withdrew 1100 TD (\~$350) total. Tunisia is cash-heavy. Plan withdrawals carefully, as you can’t take money out of the country.
* **Apps**: Bolt, Indriver, Airalo (eSIM), Glovo (need Tunisian Number for food delivery)

# Itinerary

**3 Days in Tunis**  
I stayed in La Marsa, but my Airbnb was a disaster (broken door, no towels/hairdryer, and I got trapped on the balcony for an hour when the door collapsed). The area was residential but noisy with construction and lacked privacy. Despite the rough start, I explored Medina and Sidi Bou Said my first few days.

**2 Days in Hammamet**  
I took a bus from station bab alioua for 5.50 TD, which was straightforward. Just go inside and ask people to point you to the ticket counter by saying the city name. Tip - the bus makes several stops in Hammamet so be sure to get off at the correct one. I Stayed at La Badira—a nice resort, though they didn’t honor my sea-view room request. Hammamet is mostly for relaxing; highlights included the medina, Nabeul, and Yasmine Hammamet for dinner. Nothing much to do here but a lot of tour groups depart here to the south.

**2 Days in Sahara Tour**  
I know this is not a popular option/for everyone but [this is the group I used.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tunisia/Tunisian-Sahara-Two-day-Tour-from-Hammamet/d4457-253996P13) I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with renting a car and relying on multiple louages to get to the south. It was fairly priced. You just have to pay 30 TD for the hotel at night. The itinerary included **El Jem**, **Matmata, Douz**, **Chott El Jerid**, and **Kairouan**. The guide, Mohammed, was fantastic, switching between English, French, and German. It was well-organized, and I’d recommend it if you want an stress-free way to see the south. Your hotel can help you book tours as well but I wanted to have it booked ahead of time for peace of mind because sometimes it's not always available.

**Back to Hammamet**  
Stayed at [Dar Hammamet in the medina](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tn/dar-hammamet.html?label=New_English_EN_MA%3A_Massachusetts_23537939425-w9B4IgAZbzFQj0svQ43kiwS637942152716%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9002057%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Aag23537939425%3Acmp363166345&sid=5d6ef0fed1060b9b9ce3492d5912446a&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPtPR-meQj1bevwpc--H59mw9D1kmJsOdS_TVYQ-KUjcOMwZWCKKQgwaAuwkEALw_wcB&aid=318615&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&checkin=2024-11-15&checkout=2024-11-16&dest_id=-722356&dest_type=city&group_adults=1&req_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=72b28b82ee1d0306&srepoch=1731700231&soh=1&from_sustainable_property_sr=1&from=searchresults#no_availability_msg), which was my favorite accommodation in all of Tunisia—small, cozy, and with a delicious breakfast.

**Final Days in Tunis**  
Spent more time in Sidi Bou Said, visited Carthage, and the Bardo Museum (closed Mondays, early Sundays). The Bardo Museum is free for Tunisians on first Sundays of the month, not for tourists lol. Someone told me it's free but I showed up and it's not. The ticket is 13 dinars ($4)

# Overall Impressions

Tunisia is a small country, ideal for those who enjoy a mix of exploration and downtime. Without a car, transportation can be tricky—options include trains (unreliable), louages (shared minibuses that leave when full), or buses (most convenient for me). I tried to ""wing it"" meaning I kept my itinerary open but this was not a good idea because I found there were days I wasted doing nothing. I prefer a more action packed schedule so if you're like me I recommend planning your days out or connecting with a local who will tell you exactly where to do. For example, I wanted to go to Bizerte but I didn't know what to do there so I skipped it. Or you can go with an organized tour group but it'll be the pricier option. 

**Highlights**:

* The people here are amazing. 10/10. Very helpful and welcoming. I didn’t feel like I had to be constantly looking out for being scammed.. Of course people ask you to buy things but if you say no, they leave you alone. Same with getting a taxi out of the airport. I met a few Tunisian girls and we went to the Big Dip and walked around Lake 1 and Lake 2. It was late so they drove me home so I didn’t have to take a taxi and made sure I was safe. I got super sick in Hammamet and some guy in the medina brought me medicine so these acts of kindness is how I will remember the people of Tunisia. 
* I've visited many Muslim countries including Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, but I learned the most about Islam here
* Really great Carthaginian history that I feel like not many people talk about 
* The sun is always so perfect here. I didn't feel like I was burned or blinded by it

  
**Safety as a solo woman:**

* I felt generally safe as a solo female traveler in Tunisia, with less harassment compared to Morocco or Turkey. As an Asian woman, I stood out and occasionally dealt with stares or comments like “Ni Hao,” (I'm not Chinese so I'm not sure how they expected me to react). but most interactions were harmless. I only experienced two uncomfortable incidents: a group of teenage boys circled me at a Carthage site (but left without escalation), and a man followed me in Tunis center until I managed to lose him. There were cops everywhere so I knew I would be okay if he continued to follow me. There was some catcalling in Hammamet, but none in the south. Despite these moments, no one physically threatened or harmed me, and I found the overall environment respectful
* Clothing: you'll see local girls there very fashionable and will wear crop tops. During the morning and night it gets chilly but very hot during the day. I didn't wear shorts in Tunis just to be a bit more respectful but I did wear crop tops with loose pants. Surprisingly, I got the most harassment when [I wore an abaya](https://imgur.com/a/esO1tTi) lol so just wear whatever you want

**Random Tips for travelers:**

1. **Language**: Tunisian Arabic and French are common, but English is widely understood in tourist areas. I didn't have any problems anywhere and this included taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff
2. **Photography**: Avoid taking photos of police or their buildings, even by accident.
3. **Payments**: Everything is mostly cash; foreign cards may not work everywhere. And don't expect contactless to work at ATMs so bring your physical card
4. **Hotels**: This was weird and I didn't know this but if you book a hotel on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Agoda, payments are cash on arrival. Apparently Tunisia does not accept credit card via booking online. Also don't be like me and rely on photos online. I got catfished by most of my accommodations except Dar Hammamet
5. **Taxi**: Bolt and Indriver are essential for rides but after a few days you'll realize you're paying almost double so if you want to hail a taxi, make sure it's red, ask him to turn on the meter and use your Google maps to make sure he's going the right way. I didn't get scammed by taxis at all. But if you want peace of mind about the price use Bolt. BTW Bolt works in Hammamet too. I'm not sure about other cities outside Tunis and Hammamet
6. **Restaurants**: I don't eat meat but didn't have problems finding food. The only places that stuck out to me was Dar Zarrouk in Sidi Bou Said. The food was good but definitely overpriced. But the BEST was [Les Indecis](https://www.instagram.com/lesindecis.tn/?hl=en) near one of the Carthage sites. Shoutout to the guy with curly hair for helping pick the best dish and of course BAMBALOUNI in Sidi Bou Said

Tunisia,solo travel in Tunisia,Cost of tours from Tozeur,"I am solo travelling in Tunisia and want to book a two day, one night, tour from Tozeur. I've gotten in touch with a few tour operators and they're quoting between 1050 to 2250 dinars, depending on the company. Are these prices reasonable? As they're most likely quoting private tours, I understand it should be a lot more expensive than group tours but wanted to know if there are cheaper options out there. 

Do you recommend something else? Like hiring a taxi for the day to go see the oasis sites on my own?

I am not particularly interested in visiting the Stars Wars sites for example. And have already spent a night in the desert near Merzouga in Morocco so if it's going to be a very similar experience I don't mind skipping that as well and see other parts like Chott el Djerid. 

Additional info: I am a woman and speak French, but not Arabic. Hiring a car is also not an option for me.


UPDATE POST-TRIP:
Ended up getting a bus from Sousse to Tozeur. There is one bus each day that leaves Sousse Bus Station at around 13h30 every day. It cost me 23.3 TND each way. The bus back leaves Tozeur at 7h00. 

Once in Tozeur, I found a hotel and asked the receptionist about what tours they offered. He ended up quoting me 100 EUR. I paid 338 TND, which at today's rate is around the same. This was for a private tour that included: visiting the oasis in Chebika, Tamerza and Mides, going to the desert area and seeing one of the Star Wars filming locations.

The morning of, a couple wanted to join the tour, so the receptionist gave me back 90 TND. I probably should have gotten more back but I didn't argue.",No top comment,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fldbba/cost_of_tours_from_tozeur/,"Tozeur, Tunis, Sousse, Tozeur",Price,en

Hello everyone!

My name is Mohammed from Saudi Arabia, and I'm planning to visit Tunisia for the first time at the end of May. I couldn't find a similar question in the subreddit, so I thought I'd ask for some advice. 😅

I'm a solo traveler looking to experience the best of Tunisia in just 4 days. My current plan includes visiting the following locations:

1. Medina
2. Carthage
3. Hammamet
4. Kairouan
5. El Jem
6. Matmata

1. Are these locations truly the best that Tunisia has to offer? If not, are there any other must-see places I should consider?

2. Is renting a car essential for this trip, or is there a reliable public transportation system I can use to travel between these locations?

I'm not really interested in nightlife, shopping, restaurants or bars... I only prioritize to have access to good supermarkets lol   


However, I feel like Berges du Lac may be a rather boring place and I always enjoy taking a walk around and feel the city vibes, so I'm wondering if you would suggest me to stay better in Tunis city centre. I also considered Gammarth but it looks like a place just full of dull resorts.

Tunisia,solo travel in Tunisia,Backpacking in Tunisia,"Hi guys,  
I'm from the Czech republic and want to do a solo backpacking trip. I will fly from Morocco to Tunisia and would like to ride the train from Tunis to Gabès, then do a guided tour to Jebil National Park. From pictures I think Tunisia is gorgeous land. Are there any places or ""neighbourhoods"" which I should avoid or be especially cautios in though, maybe because they don't like white visitors?

If you have any tips for town or places I should visit, please, let me know!

Take care!",No top comment,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ubud70/backpacking_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,This country is the epitome of mediocrity ,"I live abroad and spent my first summer away from the family for many reasons (overpriced flight ticket, hate the excessive heat..) so I decided that I'm going to surprise my family in October and boy what roller-coaster of emotions I went through. 

In the airport people were mean and rude to Travellers police officers were smoking and flirting with women left and right and asking unnecessary questions. Outside ستاج الوحش taxi driver behave like predators the moment they see you looking for taxi they jump on you like you're a rock star, I refused to take a ride with one of the driver because his car was in terrible conditions and smells bad and he flat out insulted despite not saying anything. 

So home is 10km away from the airport so the usual ride is 7-10 dinars max, the driver asked me for 20€ or 50 dinars lol when I told that I only pay what's in counter he told me that he turned the counter off when he pick people from the airport.. It's new policy lol. 

OK now let's put all this behind us, I'm finally home my family is happy, I'm happy and everything is fine and all of the sudden my little bro started yelling جات جات قوم فيسع And everyone rushed to close all windows when I asked what's going on they told that there's a really bad sewer smell that ""attack"" the whole neighborhood every night and ONAS told them that they cannot do nothing about it. 

Outside people drive like a maniac and act like a primitive human, trash are pilled up almost in every corner, prices are skyrocketing and it feels like every business is trying to scam you, public servants still act like they own the country. I had to interact with 4 different people in the same administration just to renew my driving license.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Freelancing FAQ in Tunisia,"It seems that every few months we get someone asking about freelancing here, which is a good thing! so i decided to share this: 

----------------

In spetember 2016, i posted this thread here: 

[My monthly income since i decided to start Freelancing in 2012 + overall details on each period. Feel free to ask anything, i'll be glad to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/)

I answered a lot of common questions in that thread so make sure to read it whenever you can, am also still doing ""freelancing"" sort of speak, am not constantly hunting for client anymore though, been working on a long term projects for years now, and i have my own company here (SUARL totalement exportatrice) in order to legitimize the whole thing, money is really good and i still work from home, feel free to ask anything.

&nbsp;

With that said, here are some answers for some of the frequently asked questions: 


------

#FAQ 
#Tunisia-related (money, legal shit, etc ...)

**How do i get paid ?**

* It depends, if you work with one of the famous platforms (upwork, fiverr) then you could use a payoneer card, but if you meet your client ""randomly"" in some forum (r/forhire, r/gameDevClassifieds, /r/slavelabour ) then you just have to talk it out, in the past i used :

* Payoneer card-to-card payement (client must have a payoneer card)

* Westerunion (expensive, avoid that)

* [WorldRemit](https://www.worldremit.com/en/tunisia/faq/cash-pickup#where-can-my-recipient-collect-the-funds-in-tunisia) (super cheap WesternUnion alternative)

* Bank wire (but don't do it for large amounts, anything less han 2000tnd should be fine)

&nbsp;

**Does payoneer work in Tunisia ?**

* Yes (but you really can't be a freelancer if you can't make a simple google search...)

&nbsp;

**Will they send me a MasterCard to my home??**

* yes

&nbsp;

**W diwena 😲??? ma yotlbouch 3leya rachwa ??**

* No

&nbsp;

**Can i send money from payoneer directly to my tunisian bank account?**

* Yes. 

Edit: few months ago i discovered that this is illegal, it is actually illegal to even have *ANY* money-service outside of Tunisia as a Tunisian citizen, you can only do that if you have residency outside of Tunisia.

Though they are not controlling this, I would highly recommend you never send money from payoneer to your Tunisian bank account, you can still use the ATM without any issues though.

&nbsp;

**What ATM do you use with Payoneer and how much they cost**

* I never used Payoneer credit card in a Tunisian ATM since 2016, i only use it online or when i travel. 

* The fees are available in [Payoneer's fee page](https://www.payoneer.com/about/fees/)

* No the Tunisian government won't bother you.

&nbsp;


**can i link a tunisian paypal account to payoneer account ?**

* Yes

&nbsp;

**can i use that paypal account to buy things ?**

* Most of the time yes (ebay, steam, g2a, etc..), but it doesn't work for subscriptions (like Netflix), for that you have to use your payoneer Mastercard directly, also some other services that doesn't have our countries in their supported list (like Nintendo and Playstation) won't accept neither your paypal nor your payoneer card


&nbsp;

**can i use that paypal account to receive money?**

* No


&nbsp;

**I don't have a payoneer account yet, and i need to pay some international fees (eg: Google/Apple dev account fees)**

* Get a ""Carte technologique""

&nbsp;

**My Client doesn't have a payoneer card what should i do?**

* When it comes to working with beginners, most clients would like to work with you through a proxy-service (fiverr, upwork, etc..), so they can get a refund when you do a terrible job (and leave you a bad review that will hunt you for years)

* If you still somehow found a client ""in the wild"", and they really wanna work with you, then WorldRemit is the easiest and fastest way to get paid, it's basicaly WesternUnion but way cheaper, and your client can pay with whatever they want, the only ""limitation"" for it is that it only works with BH (Bank d'habitat) you don't need to have a bank account, but you need to go to a BG agency and give them the transiction ID, kinda like getting a ""ماندا"" from your local post office.

* About WorldRemit, last time i used it was in 2017, and back then, despite the service being called WorldRemit in the official website, the bank agent that i dealt with (BH-Benzart) kept calling it **MoneyTrans**, so if you go there and ask about WorldRemit and they give you the usual ""nope"", make sure to ask about MoneyTrans too.

&nbsp;

**My freelancing business is getting stable income and i want to legitimize it** 

* Start a company, it doesn't cost much at all, and there is so many tax benefits for people in this line of works (assuming all of your clients are foreigners who pays in Euro/USD) 


&nbsp;


**Is there a ""Freelancer"" status in Tunisia bech n7ot'ha fi bita9et ta3rif w nodhher cool 😎?**

* No and وكيل شركة is cooler.

&nbsp;


**What are the benefits of starting a company ?? i'll be just paying taxes to this incompetent corrupt government 😠**

* It's the only way that will allow you to buy expensive things legally (car, piece of land, house, etc..)

* It's also the best and fastest way if you wanna be able to travel.

* You wont have طالب in your بطاقة تعريف  when you're clearly older than my dad...

* Extra social respect-points anywhere you go.

* Huge tax benefits if you open an international company (totalement exportatrice).

* You must do it anyway if you keep receiving ""large"" amount of money regularly (+2k/month), if you don't, it can be considered tax evasion. 

&nbsp;

**Can i send you a chat request ?** 

* unless it's an emergency and your question is VERY specific to you, i prefer that you comment here so other will benefit from it, i also hate Chat in general, so in case you still need some specific answers that for some reason you don't want them answered here, then send a direct message with all the details and i'll get back to you as soon as i can.

* TLl;DR: no chat.

#General Freelancing FAQ:

**For Programmers:**

**What should i learn**

* Whatever field you're a fan of, but the easiest one to make money with online are (in no particular order): 

* iOs and/or Android development

* Tasks Automation (bots, etc..)

* Web dev

* Game dev

* Small crossplatform apps

but don't expect to get a job ONLINE for cyber-security or some big banking software, always think about the fact that you are a total stranger to the client, so no matter how good you are, no one is gonna trust you with something worth millions of dollars *ONLINE*

&nbsp;

Also, if you are a programmer (intermediate or expert) and you're not making **at least** an extra $500 a month from side-gig as a freelancer, then you're wasting a great opportunity to make money, and you're also a total idiot and a disgrace to us programmers :) 

&nbsp;

**I am a programmer, but i don't know how to start**

* are you really ? because if by ""programmer"" you mean that you just finished 18 theoretical exams in college but have no real project at all then you are delusional, it's like calling yourself a ""writer"" simply because you graduated from ""bac lettre"", or a musician simply because you attempted to learn an instrument for one year, so at this point, you are not a programmer, you are simply a student. 

* Start making real projects, because you will NEVER get any client if you just keep learning the theory, and actually, it is a fact that most theories you learn will vanish from your skill-set if you don't practice them often enough, so the question is really simple: 

* **Can i show something to the client that will seduce them to work with me?**

* And by that i mean something along the field of the client, you can't have a portfolio full of websites, and then try to apply for a game dev job, but if you don't have a portfolio at all, then *nobody* is gonna hire you 5atrek jebt 15 fel ISET lol

* And finally, this is not at all a question related to Tunisia, beginners struggle is universal, doesn't matter if you're American or Indian, as a matter of fact, as a beginner, you have an advantage over 1st world countries because as a 20y.o from a poor/average family, a $500/month will make you feel like King Salman, but in the US this is fuck all and no one would bother with it, so use that to your advantage. 

* Google it! there is countless of reddit, youtube and various other forums post about ""getting started with freelancing"" tips, *especially* for programmers, some fields are obviously harder than other, some is hard purely because of the skill they require, and other are hard because of how saturated they are (by Indians), but it is what it is, and the whole point of this post is to show you that someone from the same background of you has made it, which mean you can make it.

&nbsp;

**For Designers:**

I don't know what should you learn, but i did hire freelance designers in the past, and the one thing i am sure of is that clients always look for ""Good final scene"", here is an example of a VERY SIMPLE 3D models but with AMAZING presentation:

* https://dribbble.com/MohChahin

And here is an example of a bad portfolio: 

* https://www.artstation.com/katisalminen

Despite the second one having models that are much more complex than the first one, I think you can all tell which one is getting more job offers.

As as a beginner designers and even intermediate/expert, keep in mind that you are gonna be working with clients who expects you to do EVERYTHING, and a well presented simple scene is way more attractive than a very technically-heavy model that looks like shit, the technical thing might be appreciated by other artists/experts, but clients who only need one job done usually never have that knowledge and only judge you as a ""casual"" person.

&nbsp;


**I don't have any Skill to sell online, am i fucked ?** 

Not really, you can always try Dropshipping, also brows /r/slavelabour  to get some ideas, but in this department usually a paypal account to receive money is crucial, so maybe try dropshipping ? (don't ask me what it is, google it), or you can bite the bullet and learn a proper skill ?

Because even if you chose dropshipping or any other e-commerce thing, the main issue is that for Skilled-Freelance the entry-fee is basically free (after aquiring the skill of course), for you however, you need a capital, to host your website, pay for good SEO, pay for Social media marketing, etc..

But it is a profitable thing nonetheless, the waiting time to make money here is also usually higher than selling your skill, so you need to be patient.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Thinking about moving back,"(Throwaway account)

Aaslema ennes lkol, 

Inchallah lkolkom labes ! It is my first post on this sub. 

So title is self explanatory but I’ll give you more context. 

I am 25 years old (soon 26), I have been living for 7 years in Paris and let’s say that career wise I have been very lucky, since graduating. 

I am in the process of joining a US crypto unicorn as head of Business Development. The position is fully remote. My total compensation package is $215K annually. So around $18K/month. I have also done well in the crypto markets and have around $400K saved in the forms of various tokens. So I am relatively upper class even in western countries standards. 

I haven’t been to Tunisia for the past 5 years now, due to mainly work and never finding the right time. I take care of my family financially so always feel pressure.

But for the past year, I have been feeling less and less good here in France. Radical changes in society in terms of more racism, more insecurity, higher cost of living, taxes… I feel like despite everything I’ll always be just « an Arab » and a foreigner. 

And in the other hand I want to spend more times with my parents (They are turning 60 this year) and family and be in a place where I am welcomed and can for exemple go to the Mosque without people viewing it as weird. 

I have many questions : How does taxation work? Should I create an offshore company in Tunisia? How does FCR actually work?

How much would I need to live a « lavish » lifestyle in Tunis : Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ? A lot people say I’m crazy to wanting to go back while others like my parents (Biased?) think it’s better and can live like a « king » here. 

Thanks 🇹🇳","u are such an inspiration man, to achieve what u achieved at 25 years old is unusual und magnificent.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Phone prices in tunisia,"!!!THIS IS ABOUT PRICES NOT PERFORMANCE!!!

So, I've just got a new job and i need a really good phone to get some tasks done (manager level job dealing with a lot of calls and emails and probably taking a lot of photos of avenues.)

Long story short, i started browsing for a smartphone and i checked how much an s23 ultra costs and that's almost 6000 dinars in all shops in tunisia while it's 1100€ (3.7k tnd) in the official samsung international shop.
I've lowered my expectations and looked more into lower budget phones, i stumbled on the A54 5G and that model also costs in tunisia a whopping 2000 dinars while it costs only 290€ (960 dinars) in the international shop!

Is this normal or what!? Is there some sort of high tax on phones or idk!?

I though about asking a family or friend memeber to get me a smartphone from abroad but the ""sajjelni"" problem crossed my mind.

Is there any shops with better prices, HELP PLEASE!

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Best way to get my phone back,"Hi all! I recently went to holiday in Tunisia. Thanks to my own bad luck on the way to the airport I left my phone in the taxi. Didn’t realise until it was far too late to do anything about it, and sadly travelled back to the UK

I tried my best to get back whatever I could of my life. I’m making progress now as I relied heavily on the FaceID and Authenticator app. However some things remain only on the phone 

I thought it was a lost cause till the daughter of the taxi driver contacted my husband (I have his number as an emergency contact on my Med page that’s accessible even when the phone is locked ) that she found the phone and wants to return it to us. That we just need to pay for the postage. We agreed then she gets back to us later saying she’s been advised that the phone will be lost or stolen. 

She assures us that she will keep the phone safe, and if we want her to send it anyway she will or alternatively we can wait till we return to Tunisia or family and friends visit 

Thing is we had no plans to ever go back, no friends or family are planning to go there. We can’t be certain how long she’ll keep the phone for us, it would be nice to get it back 

My question is, is it really that unsafe to send it in the mail? I’ve done it before with other items and not had any issues. Does anyone have any advice ?

Thanks

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Seeking Advice on Tax Residency and Legal Implications of Working Remotely in Tunisia as a UAE LLC Owner,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working in the UAE and have my own LLC there. Recently, I started working remotely from Tunisia, and I plan to stay here for 8-10 months a year due to some family issues. As a UAE resident, I don’t have to pay any taxes in the UAE, but I do need to visit twice a year to maintain my residency.

My question is: Will staying in Tunisia for 10 months create any problems for me, especially at the airport when traveling or going back to the UAE? Also, do I need to pay taxes in Tunisia? If so, how do I go about it? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you recommend?

From what I understand, staying in Tunisia for more than 183 days would make me a tax resident here. I’ve also heard that the only time I might encounter issues is if I decide to buy a house, land, or a car otherwise I will be safe. Is that true?

Another option I have, though it's more complicated, involves the fact that there is no double taxation for dividends paid by a UAE company to a Tunisian resident as an investor. However, it’s illegal for Tunisian residents to own a company abroad. So, I’m considering maintaining my UAE residency, keeping my company there, and paying myself dividends in Tunisia at the end of the year while staying here almost year-round. 

I’m concerned that in order to maintain my UAE residency, I need to be employed by my own company as a manager, which could complicate things further in Tunisia.

I know this is complicated and not very clear, especially since the laws in Tunisia are unclear when it comes to uncommon situations like mine. Please share any thoughts or advice you may have. Any information would be truly appreciated. I want to avoid any legal issues, I don’t wanna do anything illegal and wanna stay safe.

(Please don’t suggest creating an LLC in Tunisia. I think paying 10% on dividends for tax, 19% VAT, 10% CNSS, and more for my salary is too much. That’s why I created my LLC in the UAE. My original plan was to stay there and in Asia as a digital nomad, but unfortunately, things changed, and family comes first.)

Thanks! ","I lived outside Tunisia (not in the UAE) for multiple years, and came back a little less than 10 years ago to work remotely.


To remain completely legal :
* You need to keep your foreign residency in order to be legally entitled to own foreign companies / banking, so you need to fulfill the yearly requirements to keep your residency active.
* As long as you have your residency, customs won’t bug you at any airport.
* **BUT** This is a completely different subject than taxation, if you spend more than 180 days in Tunisia at any given year, you become fiscal resident in Tunisia (Residency and fiscal residency are two different topics). Meaning that you need to pay taxes on your worldwide income in Tunisia no matter what the rules are where you’re doing business. So for example I know you don’t have taxes in foreign income in Dubai, but if are fiscal resident in Tunisia, you pay taxes at the Tunisian rates, and you have to report those benefits or you’ll be doing tax evasion like many knattreyya.


It’s overall straightforward, you fill your yearly requirements to maintain your residency in UAE this will make your situation clear with customs.
And declare your benefits to tax office and pay your taxes in Tunisia to avoid tax fraud.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1er4bm0/seeking_advice_on_tax_residency_and_legal/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

3 - Private University if affordable, I don't know anybody who failed private university (unless they didn't pay)  
4 - Do Nothing cause broke and have Ego.

I want to know your opinions on this BUT especially women's opinions between option 1/4.

I ask this because I've been traveling around European countries for the previous 2 years,  and I've seen girls working in many different jobs that I've never seen women do in  Tunisia (or it's too rare).  
  
Small example, when I get into a bus/metro in Europe you have a 30% chance to have a woman driver, in Tunisia it's 1% (I actually never seen one but I said 1 because they surely exist).  
When I get into a coffee shop / Bar in Europe it's 50% to be a women waitress, in Tunisia it's 15%.

Also men, would you be okay with your wife/daughter/sister doing these jobs ?   
  
I ask this because in my family, I have some female cousins who actually chose to stay unemployed rather than working a menial job (they failed high school/university -> did a formation/ Private University-> didn't find a job -> Unemployed for years)

So is it only my extended family (that I already know is toxic and have crazy ego) or is this common in Tunisian families ?

Disclaimer for my fellow Nerds: the statistics that I gave are from **my experience based** on a small experience that I've been doing since 2 Months, whenever I go to a place I just adjust my statistics.","I think your analytical instinct is asking some good questions. However, it can't be as simple as a ""would you rather"" question with just a few variables. When I think about this subject, countless factors come to mind: age, gender (which you already mentioned), socioeconomic status, environment (including family), personality, compensation, type of employment, location, the reasons for misalignment with the free education system in Tunisia (which is a huge factor on its own), working conditions, motivation, aspirations, job market, goverment inatiatives, etc.. 

Most importantly, seeking a simple answer wouldn't be very helpful. Many people will respond based on their own experiences and biases, so you might not end up with objective or truly helpful answers. In fact, some people might even give answers that, deep down, they don’t fully believe themselves.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Urgent Help Needed to Save My Business from Financial Collapse,"
Hi Reddit,

I’m reaching out because I’m in a really difficult spot right now. I own a small travel agency business in Tunisia, and things have gone from challenging to critical in the last few months.

I chose to stay here to face these struggles because my family is deeply tied to this business. I can’t walk away and leave them drowning in debt—we’ve all put everything we have into making this work. I do have a solid plan to save the business, but with the financial pressure and constant challenges, I’m finding it impossible to move forward on my own.

I’m looking for any type of financial support or advice. Whether it’s an investment, a loan, or even suggestions on grants or assistance programs, I’m open to anything that can help us pull through.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has some guidance, I’d be incredibly grateful for any help. I just want to get back on track and keep fighting for this dream, for myself and my family.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Tips and questions for visiting Tunisia. ,"Firstly I appreciate this must get asked a lot so thank you for taking the time. Myself and my family are booked to visit Tunisia next June and I have some questions regarding visiting Tunisia that I'd appreciate help on.

Firstly I'm not dumb enough and naive enough to ask is Tunisia safe, like most cities I am traveled to I am sure it is fine you just need to be sensible.

Whilst a lot of our time will be taken in the resort it would be rather silly of me to not explore and experience the rich and vibrant history that Tunisia has to offer, with that in mind I also want to be respectful of local customs and practices and as such have a few questions. For clarification were visiting a resort in Monastir towards the Sousse end.

1. Food, I am a food lover and when visiting other countries I try to explore the local cuisine, I don't mean the ""local"" dishes they serve tourists in many resorts but I mean truly authentic local dishes. For me sea food is my passion and being on the coast I imagine the city has some amazing sea food places. With that in mind I would love your recommendation on both dishes to try and maybe even restaurant in the area.
2. When traveling the city and exploring. Am I best to hire a local guide for the day? Or explore myself, any must visit places? We plan to take a tour of Amphitheater of El Jem but any other attraction that you would say is a must? I have heard the mosques are beautiful but do they welcome visitors? I don't wish to be disrespectful and want to be as polite as possible.
3. Language and local customs. This is important to me, I appreciate the main language of Tunisia is Arabic with French being quite common, how common is English? Also any recommendeded phrases or sayings you'd suggest I learn to help communicate? I am a firm believer that as the visitor it is my duty to try to learn your language and customs and not expect the locals to cater for me. That said, I also wish to be respectful of customs and local traditions. Can anyone suggest areas or customs I should observe to be respectful, I know in some Muslim countries women should have their hair covered, outside of the resort would it be polite for my wife to do this with a scarf, or is it generally accepted that tourists wouldn't?
4.  And finally, currency and any other tips? I understand the Dinar is a closed currency and I need to get my Dinar there, I can't also take it out of the country, any tips for this? (Although I may be best asking on a travel group for this) And finally. Anything else you can suggest or tips you can give.

Thank you for taking the time and I am excited to visit your country. (And I don't just mean the holiday resort/beach)",No top comment,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fu2k6i/tips_and_questions_for_visiting_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Monastir",General,en
Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Visiting Tunisia as a group of women: looking for tips!,"I'm an Algerian woman in my 20s and I currently live overseas. My mother still lives in Algeria and I've been saving up to pay for a trip with her and my siblings. 

Logistics and visa paperwork are hellish so my first choice is Tunisia since my family won't need a visa and they recently opened a train line between Annaba and Tunis. 

The thing is, our entire group is made-up of women (there's my mother, then me, then my two younger sisters and my baby niece (my older sister will probably not be able to come)). We don't have a mahram (please spare me the lectures 🙏🏼) and my biggest fear when traveling is harassment. 

It's one thing to experience harassment as a woman when you're traveling with your friends but it's another thing when you're with your family. I'm genuinely scared I might lose my cool if someone bothers my mom or sisters and I might end up in trouble in a foreign country so I'm kinda worrying.

My question is: what's the best family-friendly city to visit in Tunisia? Do you have any activities to suggest too? Please drop your recommendations in the comments (not too pricey though please. I'm poor, I just wanna do something nice for my mom without declaring bankruptcy lol). I know my mom would just be fine with whatever I suggest but I really want her to enjoy the trip so if you have any idea what a 50yo woman might enjoy in Tunisia, I'm ALL EARS!!! 

btw please do not take offense with my question. I also worry about harassment even when I travel within Algeria. I just would like to prepare myself carefully since I'd be responsible for my entire family this time.

Thanks in advance!!","Don’t worry especially since your Arab/arab speaking.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Interfaith religious marriage,"Hello fellow redditors,

I come to you with a very personal question regarding my situation.

We partner and I would like to get married in Tunisia.

I am a non-muslim french and she's a Muslim Algerian. Because of traditions and beliefs it is important for her family that we do a religious marriage.

Tunisia seems like a good place to do so as we both like the country and it is easier for everyone to travel there, i.e., no visa required for both families. 

In France it is quite common to see a non religious person marrying a catholic one, if the couple is ok with it so is the priest marrying them.

I am wondering if the same could happen in Tunisia or if I must convert to Islam beforehand. 

Thanks a lot,

Cheers !","I'm not a Tunisian Law nor Islamic Law specialist so take this with a grain of salt, but as far as I'm aware you could get married in Tunisia without converting but that wouldn't be considered a 'religious marriage'  and it would be a civil contract of marriage (the same you would get in France).

I'm not a faqih but the general position of Sunni Islam Fiqh is that an Islamic marriage contract won't be valid if the groom is not Muslim. If you want your marriage to be recognized in the eyes of God you will have to convert.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/woszu7/interfaith_religious_marriage/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Reflections on Our Tunisian values and reality,"I understand this might be a contentious topic, but let's debate this rationally without emotions running high: Many Tunisians here seem deeply attached to liberal Western values, even believing we are part of the West. However, our beliefs and feelings don't always align with reality. The truth is, Tunisia is a North African Muslim-majority country, much like the Philippines is a Southeast Asian Buddhist-majority country. No matter how much we try to emulate the West, the need for visas to travel there and our non-Western identity remain evident (I live in the West, so this is a firsthand observation).

Furthermore, embracing liberal values as absolute truths just because we believe in them doesn't make them universally correct. These values weren't universally accepted even in the USA in the 1960s. What has changed since then? If we claim our morals have evolved, would we be okay if, in 20 years, incest ( relationship between a father and a daughter, or a brother to a sister, or a brother to a brother) became morally acceptable, arguing that it doesn't harm anyone if both parties consent?

It's worth noting that the West is currently experiencing societal conflicts and questioning these very morals, as evident in discussions by prominent figures like Joe Rogan (renowned podcast host), Elon Musk , Tucker Carlson (ex Fox News host and the most popular journalist active on twitter now), and Candace Owens, Alex Jones. Many in the West believe that these values have eroded traditional family structures and society as a whole. Some are turning towards more settled cultures and religions, such as Orthodoxy, Islam, or relocating to places in the Middle East or Asia like Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia, where such values are still embraced in a more developed context.

What we see as the 'amazing West' today is a consequence of post-World War II and Cold War success, but things are evolving and now it's shifting to the east. While this might not be fully recognized in Tunisia yet, it's the reality—regardless of our personal feelings. Just like the truth about the Earth's shape, reality remains steadfast and unyielding and whatever flat earthers feel or believe won't change that truth.","Info: which “western values” are you referring to exactly and why do you think morals evolving equates being okay with incest? Also why do you consider red pill podcasters ….”Prominent figures” lol.  

This rant makes no sense, too generalised, you’re doing a lot of mental gymnastics here to prove changing morals is a bad thing, when that’s how societies evolve. 

نمشي معاك بمنطقك، ياخي تتخيل العباد كان عندهم نفس الmoral code في عهد الجاهلية و بعد دخول الإسلام ؟ علاش فرحان بالتغيير هذاكا أما كي نحكيو على المساوة بين الجنسين و لا حرية الدين و المعتقد و إلخ يولي التغير خايب و incest و منعرش شنوة و لازمنا نحافظو على الmorals متاعنا، ياخي عمرك ريت واحد ليبرالي قالك نحب انيك اختي و لا بنتي؟ تي انت بيدك غسلولك مخك ال“prominent figures” الي تحكي عليهم و وليت تحكي كيف كل red pill podcaster اللي معندهم حتى صلة بالهوية التونسية و لاهم يعرفو عداتنا و تقاليدنا و لا يحترمو دينا لا شي.

this time this is the longest I stay and my wife is away for work and I won't be joining her until September. this has created a big void and kind of lost of what to do with my day as friends that are still here are either working the whole day and usually don't want to do anything at night (I don't blame them, I do the same) or with their families.

We're in a similar situation. Most of my friends have left the country or moved to other cities. I find myself riding solo most of the time and doing activities alone, like going to cafés, restaurants, and playing sports.

I've made a few connections through various activities, but they usually don't last long since we don't have much in common. For example, with the guys I met at the gym, our conversations rarely go beyond gym-related topics.

I'd suggest shifting your focus from seeking deep friendships to finding companions for the activities you enjoy.

I don't think you have to worry about your safety at all, as long as you are staying with your dad and family, who know how the country works. I'm sure there are reasons why your dad thinks badly of Tunisia - after all he decided to leave the country for greener pastures, but it doesn't mean that there aren't any good things!

Some aspects are just humbling, like knowing that my cousins have to work 2 months to gain what i gain in a week - makes me overthink what small stupid things i worry about in my life. There are also things which I was only able to learn in Tunisia and which i wish would be more of a thing in Europe: i love the importance of family in Tunisia, the social warmness, the hospitality. I love all the beautiful places i have seen there and having a connection to another country than the one i grew up in.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,"My experience in Tunisia as an Italian, and my unconditional love for Mulukhiyah.","First of all, sorry if I misspelled Mulukhiyah. 
I've been in Tunisia years ago because one of my friends was getting married. She is from Monastir. 

Your weddings are crazy guys, it was a traditional one, and it lasted 1 week. Everyday the bride would wear a stunning dress, and everyone would dance on the rythm of darbouka. Everyday, even at the house, she had 15 different cousins, aunts and uncles come by and just chill, dance and eat. Like, how good is the Makroudh?

Anyways, I got maybe 10 hours of sleep in a week because the ceremony would last until late at night and the aunts started cooking really early, being very loud. That's was fun tho.

I went there a bit sceptical, because unfortunately there are a lot of bad stereotypes about Arab countries, but holy moly you guys are the kindest, most open heart people I've ever met (and I've traveled a lot). You make sure your guests are always welcome. One day I craved coffee, the cousins drove 15 km just to buy me moka coffee. I was thristy? Well they jumped in the kitchen to grab me any kind of drink. I was hungry in the middle of the night? Say no more! Here's a couscous for you my friend!

Really, words cannot described how easily you people can make a foreigner feel part of the family, it's like you do everything you can to make them feel home. And you easily go out of your comfort zone just to make the guest feel comfortable, like some family members slept on the floor just so I could sleep on the bed! (I felt bad about it).

Now, let's talk about Mulukhiyah. The aunts cooked it one day in the garden, a huge quantity. And oh my it's the best dish I've ever had. There is a ton of oil in there, but I don't care like, how did you guys come up with this recipe? It's simply amazing.

As we say in Italian, you guys have ""il cuore nella mano"" (You heart is in your hand, meaning you give all your heart to people).

I wish I could come back to Tunisia very soon. Stay safe my friends!","Just to add one more thing, I've learn you Tunisians don't take ""no"" for an answer when it comes to offer food.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,How to spend/finance 1300 TND,"I am a 17M at highschool, I worked as a freelancer this summer and I made (after tax) 1300TND, this money is stored in USD on a paypal account that I can withdraw from, I want to spend it but I am not sure on what (and if I even should in this economy)

first thing I thought of was getting upgrades for my PC like a proper mechanical keyboard and a slightly better gpu, but I already spend a ton of time on my computer and I want to do other stuff with this money now

another option I ruled out is a  yearly subscribtion to the climbing gym in marsa, it's a sport I like + I get fit as I do it but el marsa is too far for me and they are raising the prices because of inflation anyways

possible contenders:

\- travel somewhere: I dunno if this money is enough to travel somewhere nice, I've never travelled before but I'd like to meet people and experience the country authentically not just stay in a hotel all week. so I am fine with backpacking and hitchhiking. I already have a passport if that helps but in case I do this I probably won't have any money afterwards and I am not sure if it's worth it.

\- help my family: we are not in extreme poverty, about middle class but everything's got pricier and I'd love to do something to help

\- save it: un-experienced in saving so not sure

\- going on a bunch of mini adventures: this is the one I am leaning towards the most, I could go on like 30 or 40 one-day trips to a bunch of places in tunisia with louage. things like kef, ain draham.. it's not enough to take my family or friends with me and maybe travelling alone will be boring  also not sure.

\- get a drawing tablet and learn to draw : I think I could get a wacom tablet for 500TND and maybe I'll have fun? I am not good at drawing but this is the thing that'll keep me engaged the longest out of the other options cause I can draw even after I spend the money. not sure.

of course I could do any combination these provided I don't go over the limit. if you have other suggestions let me know below. I'd love if a finance expert gives me a breakdown of how best to spend it, but anyone can recommend stuff.

&#x200B;","As someone who's a bit older and currently studying in college in Tunisia, I suggest u save your money for after your BAC ( since you're 17 I assume you're 3eme or pass BAC ) 
College isn't really expensive but it's a great place to socialize and meet new people and have fun before corporate life takes over when u graduate. And let me tell you socializing isn't free in Tunisia hobbies are expensive as well so my advice if you're looking to have the best possible college life experience here is to save your money for that / or invest it in things that will help u in your freelancing stuff; a new pc for example or a really confortable chair/desk for working and studying ( trust me in this one, your back ages 4 time faster that u xD )",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/16bl0j4/how_to_spendfinance_1300_tnd/,"Unknown, Tunis",Inquiry,en
Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Apartment left in a will to me (I live in Europe),"My Dad died earlier this year in Tunisia.  He has an estate there and has left part of it to me.  As part of the process a family member has asked for power of attorney to sign documents on my behalf.  For those who have been through probate, does that sound right?  Would I be needing to sign something?  If yes can this not be done remotely?

I am unable to travel (disability) and don't really want the property for myself - family will be living in it.

Anyone know how I go about getting power of attorney, or some other way of completing the process whilst not in Tunisia?  Presumably it has to be via a Tunisian solicitor?  Can it be done online somehow?

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Visiting Tuinisa for 10 days,"Hello , i will be visiting Tunisia soon for about 10 days but 4 of those days will be in Ramadan so I will be restricted to do much during those days. I will be fasting too so I was thinking to spend those 3-4 days of Ramadan in the capital, Tunis, since traveling around with no food or water will be hard. Unless someone has some other idea of what I can do in Ramadan for those 4 days.

I am visiting to see a close friend of mine, and he lives in the capital Tunis, but I would like to still be able to explore some of the country while im there. He is busy with work/family, but I can still spend some time with him in the capital. Currently I have Bizerte, Sidi bou said/Carthage, Kairouan, and Zaghouan(This was recommended to me). I would love to be able to visit Sousse and more of the desert areas, but taking into account my time restraint and that i want to spend time with my friend as well, i have only these locations in mind which are relatively close to the capital.

I am going to land in Tunis, Carthage airport and am thinking of going to Sidi bou said for 2 nights, so the night i arrive and night after that. Then go to Bizerte for 1 full day , 1 night. After that head to El Menzah, since i heard its peaceful compared to downtown Tunis and very close.As for Kairoan and Zaghouan I wanted to make these each a 1 day trip, from El Menzah, so i would come back the same day. So thats 5 days, then i have 1 day left before Ramadan and 4 days of Ramadan.

I would like to take the input of you guys. Would it be better for me to just go directly to El Menzah and then from there I can do a day trip to Bizerte, day trip to Sidi bou said, same for Kairouan and Zaghouan, or stay with my current plan? And for Bizerte and Sidi bou said, is 1 day enough for each of them or should i do 2 and 2? If anyone has any other way I can manage this, I would love to hear any recommendations. I'm also trying not to travel at night, city to city, since i don't know how safe Tunisia is at night.",No top comment,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1b098b7/visiting_tuinisa_for_10_days/,"Unknown, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage, Bizerte, Kairouan",General,tl
Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Being Trans While Visiting Tunisia?,"Hi! Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit, thanks in advance for your patience.

Context: My mother immigrated to the US from Tunisia when she was young, and I've always wanted to take her there and visit because she hasn't been back since.

Problem: I am a transmasculine person. I mostly pass as male when in public and have medically transitioned.

Question: What sorts of things should I know regarding being trans in Tunisia? I go stealth for safety reasons whenever traveling, but is there anything in particular I need to be respectful of or careful with? Places that are slightly safer for people like myself?

Thank you for reading and considering my questions! Have a good day!

Update 10/26: Thank you so much for your comments and help! I hope to one day support my mother in visiting her place of birth, and also to have a chance to learn about my family's heritage in a safe and respectful way. I feel a bit more informed and will do more research on the things you have provided 💜🙏🏾","What does your passport say? Male or female?

As long as you look like your passport, you should be fine. Otherwise, you may be deemed suspicious by police in the airport. Also, avoid talking too much to people and try also to avoid awkward situations. Public toilet use might be problematic also for you, so be careful there.

I don't want to sound negative but in general, you won't be welcomed with arms wide open. Whoever will know your situation will likely make fun of you, insult you or even try to hurt you physically. Only few people will accept you as you are.

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,What the life of Samir Loussif can teach the younger generations.,"https://youtu.be/r47d-SgGKxs?feature=shared


It is very important people understand life and it is equally important we do it while at the same time keeping in mind that this is r/tunisia so our reference should always be Tunisian things and people.  

It was 1995 and Samir Loussif's star started brightly shining in the sky of mezwed music in Tunisia. He was young, vibrant, energetic, had a crazy voice and everything seemed just wonderful. Nothing stood in the way at that time. 

He produced music as fuck. He traveled the country. He sang in every village and every festival. He travled the world and sang to Tunisians everywhere. He was famous and people respected him. It was 2005 and the ""ana j'en ai marre"" album was a big hit. So far everything was quite good even though problems had already managed to start. 

Despite all this, life was never that good for Samir. In all this he was struggling with alcohol, family problems, divorce and being away from his son who lives in Sweden, and a generally very unstable life. 

What looked like a bright future in 1995 turned out to be a complete nightmare for the superstar. Yet most people don't understand that they should choose carefully which path they should take in order to live a happy and stable life. 

The life of Samir was indeed a big lesson but the life of Michael Jackson is a much bigger lesson but this is r/Tunisia as already mentioned.",No top comment,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17fl91s/what_the_life_of_samir_loussif_can_teach_the/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Torn between staying or leaving Tunisia," I'm so torn between staying or leaving Tunisia in the future.

I have a good relationship with my parents and I appreciate them a lot. They both want me to work in another country after I finish my degree since the industry I chose isn't that big in Tunisia and I've always wanted to leave too, I don't see myself doing well here, and even if I do it won't pay me well. I work in film vfx and my goal is to be a vfx supervisor one day and the field here and in other countries is so different since others are much more advanced so it'll be a whole different experience. We barely even use vfx here in Tunisia.

But the thing is, I'm so attached to my family, and thinking of leaving my parents alone breaks my heart. Both my siblings have left already, one is in japan and the other in europe and the house feels empty without them so I can't help but think how my parents would feel if I leave too. They're both getting old but dad still works all day so my mom would be all alone when usually I'm the one who keeps her company. 

 One of my goals in life is to make my parents happy and pay them back for everything they did for me. Even tho they had many problems they still tried their best to raise me well and I appreciate that a lot. We have never traveled together so I want to take them on a vacation in the future, take them to good restaurants, and do the family things we've never done before because they were always busy and couldn't afford such expenses. I just want to see them happy and know that I'm the reason for it.  
However I know that if I stay in Tunisia and work here It'll take me so long to save up for something like that, I'll get paid minimum wage but If I work in another country I'll get paid in a better currency, I also don't mind working a lot and saving up so it'll be much easier and faster to save money.  


I don't know what to do, I still have a lot of time to think more but I also want to hear others' opinions. Am I too attached to my parents? What do you think is better, stay here or go aboard?","You and I have the exact same situation. They are my number one priority.
But I left. Why? Because their mission is to make sure I have a bright future (which can't be done in Tunisia).


They said of course! Who doesn't want their child to be by their side, specially that they're gettig older and might need my presence to not feel alone, or to help them with everyday stuff.
But, they said, our goal is to push you towards a stable, healthy, productive and happy life, plus you can't just stick by our sides forver. 

Attachment in this case does more harm than good. It gets in the way of personal growth and financial stability.
On the bright side, they will have the chance to focus on themselves, and enjoy their golden years. That's how things are meant to be.

You can always fly home as often as you want, if you live in europe, near an airport, it would probably be very easy to travel to tunisia with a backpack, spend 2 or 3 days, and go back. It's not that far by plane. I have a couple of friends who do it regularly.


So my advice is to just go for it, you won't regret it. All of you will be happy",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wq6hha/torn_between_staying_or_leaving_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

We want somewhere which will offer nice beaches, have something to do outside of the resort ( I will be exploring the city ) has good places to eat and will just be fun for a family of three, I am looking at all inclusive hotels and Hammamet & Sousse keep popping up.

This will be our first time in Tunisia, we usually travel to Agadir Morocco and have a blast there so a city quite similar would be perfect.","I will personnally recommend Sousse.

Sousse is great for families because it have nice beaches, a lot of family activities( Port El Kantaoui, Medina,...) various restaurants and cultural activities.

Plus Sousse is in the center of many sites and cities: You can easily travel from Sousse to the capital, Monastir, Kairouan, Hammamet, Mahdia, you have a zoo that in my memories was great in Enfidha( Friguiya park), etc.

So it's a good compromise because you can spend a day just in the beach in Sousse and the other day visiting the city, plus you can easily visit another city if you get tired of Sousse.

Those who travel to Tunisis by car/moto (boat) are there any tips or things I should know?

Thanks!","I just did the Mediterranean boat transit last month. 

1. Try to do all the paperwork before disembarking. I think you can do that even in a Corsica Linea ship. (I was on a CTN ship)

2. Be prepared to spend three or four hours in customs. They ask every single car to put out every single thing in the car. It takes ages! If you are unlucky you'll find yourself behind someone with a car full of crap which takes so much time to be put out and back again, so you'de be stuck even if you already have been inspected and ""liberated"" (this is what happened to me).

Tunisia,family travel in Tunisia,Aidkom mabrouk everyone! At this occasion I felt like giving my 2 cents on the state of the Subreddit (Meta post),"Aidkom mabrouk! Whether believers or not, I hope you enjoyed celebrating with your family and/or friends.

I wanted to talk a bit about r/Tunisia since it has been a long time since we last did. These last months I noticed a rise of the random Tunisian users I encounter on Reddit, and this is just on the subs I frequent like r/Soccer and r/leagueoflegends. There is about [80 Tunisian flairs on r/soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerbot/wiki/africa/tunisia), and this [6k upvotes post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/712knt/in_tunisia_buying_8250_rp_costs_193_dinars_the/) had a lot of Tunisians too.

However, I never saw most of these Tunisian users participating here. When questioning some of them, they would cite the inactivity of this sub, calling it ""dead"". But here's the thing : People aren't refraining from coming because the ""sub is dead"", it's the other way around. Abstention will create and accentuate inactivity.

Of course, I'm not saying any Tunisian redditor is entitled to come take part here. It should be an effort from both sides. If this place becomes more attractive to people, user base will inevitably increase. So first i'm gonna talk about what distinguishes r/tunisia and Reddit from other available social medias :

* The upvote/downvote system : It's not a perfect one, but it helps distinguish good and bad content. It also help having moderators to remove spam. Also the Reddit karma system ""rewards"" users for posting good content.

* English discussions : It is allowed to talk in derja/french here, but there isn't a lot of english places on the internet about tunisia. The only other one I know is the expats in Tunisia group on Facebook.

* The niche aspect : If you feel like Facebook/Instagram are too mainstream for them, some people could find Reddit comfortable and refreshing for them. It's much easier to talk about ""taboo"" topics here because of anonymity. It also helps that there's a lot of very useful subreddits on this website.

Right now, the most frequent topic here is by far asking about informations on Tunisia. That's of course fantastic, we Tunisians love to talk about our country and it means people are interested about it. But here's what we could gladly see more of :

* Humourous content : There's no rules against memes/low effort content. If you found something funny you thought about sharing it on Facebook or to friends, post it here! We will probably like it too.

* Tunisian OCs : if you saw a drawing/song/cool thing made by a Tunisian, feel free to share! Tunisian youtube channels are also welcome.

* Travel pics and experiences : If you recently made a trip to Tunisia and captured some cool sceneries, it would be cool to see them. It would be also interesting to hear how people felt about it. by the way places reviews are okay, as long as it's not cheap advertisement.

* Popular topics : We all know that Tunisians turn into 11 million politicians in elections and 11 million coaches in sports tournaments. It would be nice to discuss more of those. The world cup just started for example, it's an excellent occasion to talk about how the Tunisian team will do under the world's spotlight.

Quick note : Just because it would be nice to get bigger, doesn't mean it's okay to break Rule 1.

**TL;DR : This place is nice but it can be much better. Be the change you want to see.**

I was in Turkey last year during Eid and I got trapped in a small town for over a week because everything was shut down with no free public transportation.

I’m kinda worried I’ll be losing a good portion of my trip to not being able to move around and find free space louage before during and after.

Thoughts on the limitations I’ll face? I’m starting in Tunis on the seventh, and I hope to spend a good portion of my time in the mid/south.


Edit: if anyone finds this post via searching for similar information, just as an update, it was possible to get food and a place to stay during Eid in the places I was at but mostly limited to fast food. I made friends on Couchsurfing and joined a family for the holiday and it was a great experience. Eid was mostly short lived compared to some countries but lots of people go home and so some businesses are closed longer while people are away. Car rental was virtually impossible during this time.",In the most touristy places you would find things still working. So if you accept to just chill in a beach side resort for two or three days then it will be OK. On the other hand if you're interested in the culture and city life then definitely you need to reschedule your trip.,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cl2g0g/traveling_in_tunisia_during_eid/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

I'd like to preface this post and say that this year will be my 14th visit to Tunisia. I am 25 and the first time I've been is with my family way back when I turned 8 years old. I've visited all the touristy places and the usual attractions and I've started exploring the cities and country itself for what it really is.

Europe is our main economic partner, We're also socially tied to it to a certain degree given the large Tunisian diaspora living there. So one can't help but conclude that the shift to the right can be very significant for us.

First off, did you vote? Do you think that you as an expat here will be affected by the European union becoming decidedly right leaning, and your country specifically becoming that way also? ( in the case of France by next month there will probably be a far right parliament). Will your family and friends back home be affected? In the case of Germany it seems the eastern states are the right leaning ones. Did the result surprise you?

 When Meloni took power she seemed to have no problem making deals with our government. Those deals will see the immigration problem that Italy faces become our problem, so they're not that popular as you may imagine. Do you think your government will do the same thing?

I’ve already posted on r/TEFL but I thought it might be good to check here.

I’d like to know what life is like for expats in Tunisia, Tunis specifically. If there are any expats in this sub, how do you find it? 

To me it looks beautiful and the food looks amazing and Tunisian dialect sounds very interesting.

I am also interested in the experiences of women in Tunisia. There is a lot of conflicting experiences or information about women in Tunisia - even on this sub. So maybe it’ll just be more contradictions, but I’d like to hear all of them.","I'm a guy so can't really help with the female experiences, but I have lived in Tunis since August 2019 and absolutely love it. Tunisia is the 30th African country that I have lived, worked or travelled in and I moved here directly from my previous location of Madagascar. I guess this influences my opinion a lot, as I have just relocated from one of the poorest places in Africa to one of the richest, and I really appreciate the difference:  safe, plentiful fresh produce, access to some consumer goods, excellent roads, good restaurants (with many delivery options!), good healthcare availability or easy medical evacuation to Europe, no Malaria, cheap and diverse array of flight options (before covid-19!), cheap fuel, the beautiful Dars you find dotted everywhere, an amazing diversity of natural landscapes to explore, and a beautiful coastline that allows me to kayak, kitesurf and surf. In fact, Djerba is probably one of the best places in the world to learn to kitesurf, I'd highly recommend it!

Everyone seems to complain about the driving standards as if they're the worst in the world, but I think it's not too bad. Certainly no worse than many other places I have travelled. Drive defensively and you should be fine. I am here to write the Bradt Travel Guide to Tunisia (1st Edition), which involves a lot of travel around Tunisia. Thus far I have been to 21 of the country's 24 governorates, so I haven't just been sitting in the capital. I have done tens of thousands of kilometers of Tunisia's roads and haven't crashed yet. I have never been made to feel unwelcome anywhere I went, and a lot of people have gone out of their way to help me with directions / advice / when my car broke down!

I have also been impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit of many of the younger Tunisians I have met, running all sorts of weird and wonderful internet startups or small businesses. It's great to see that most of them completed their education abroad, but still chose to move back here despite some of the problems of living and working in Tunisia. Also, even if you do not speak French or Tunisian Arabic, you should still find this a pretty easy place to communicate, as a lot of the younger generation speak a good level of English.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jfqbt9/expat_life_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

- are the locals warm and nice ?
- is tunisian culture insteresting ?
- is there interesting people to meet ?
- I only speak french and english. Is it enough ?","Local people are very friendly and welcoming. Most Tunisians speak French but few of them speak English (You can get along with locals). Most of the stuff are cheap comparing it to other countries. A coffee would cost $0.3-$1, and a sandwich $1-$3.

There are many interesting places you can visit ([list here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293753-Activities-Tunisia.html))


**My recommendations:**

* Always carry your passport with you.

* Get a local SIM card. It's only $2.5 and it normally has $30 worth of services. 

* Always carry cash with you. Most local shops/stores do not accept Credit Cards. (AFAIK)

* If you're planning to go somewhere/do something, I'd recommend you do it during daylight.

* Many sellers will try to double charge you for cheap items. So be careful (Especially in Touristic zones)

* Don't forget to try Traditional Couscous, Lablebi, and Kafteji. These are very popular dishes in Tunisia!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/46aso7/life_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,it
Tunisia,expat life in Tunisia,[OPINION] Tunisia situation from a global view,"Personally, I don't believe that Tunisia is a project of a country that can progress. Even if they get rid of all  problems ( corruption, unemployment, bureaucracy, rentier economy and rusty infra...). 
Why ? Because, we as a people still have the mindset on depending on the government. we depend on gov. in education, we depends on gov. in healthcare and we depends on gov. in infrastructure. Too many tasks to do, and too many employees to feed, but the governor remains with a bit of resources.
A socialist model of a country will always put it in unbalanced situation. There are many services provided by the state ,and the state isn't a growing economy like South Korea, nor an oil land like Saudi Arabia. We're more like the Philippines who back in the 60s invested in the immigration of thousands of young men and women in order to work or to study. A country that invests in the expertise of its expats who bring in the hard currency from especially the US. 

To summarize, if we want to progress we must lessen the burden for gov. And let companies (foreign or national) invest in the local market and enter the field of public services, then the life quality will gradually increase with an open market without any involvement from the state.","Who should we rely on in education and healthcare?

You're going to Tunisia...where is that? Did you see the news of that attack in Tunisia - don't go there. Support for my leaving on this very unclear adventure is at an all time low. You can find support for anything on the internet, all sorts of weirdos out there -- so here I am. I'm not really worried about my security, but I do enjoy being alive. And I’m not really worried I’m getting in over my head, I didn’t sign up for anything but to keep living. I’m only casually self-discussing the darija course at the Bourguiba institute. 

First off, my plan is this, I've got a guy on couchsurfing that says I should bring him some organic cacao nibs and he'll let me stay with him for a bit until I can find an apartment. The chocolate is in the mail, Habibi. I've ended up with an extra 600 dollars a month (this is enough right?) in my life to go hang out in Tunisia for a bit. I want to run the beach, eat the fresh food, swim around and get tan and feeling good. My Arabic understanding is pretty bad with this Tunisian dialect (I've been watching some Tunisian films - oooh lala) I understand gulfies more. I was a student of Arabic for several years but when talking to people I would hear a sentence without understanding a single word sometimes. I throw my MSA out there, smile, they get what I'm going for, then they start talking like a baby to me. Its pathetic, but it gets the shugul done. 

My flight date approaches. I bought my ticket before this fiasco and I’m poor so I’m flying there just to get my money’s worth. I’m reading through everything on google about expats or Americans in Tunisia. I suppose its not everything, I'm only reading in english. Bien, merci. Ca Va?

Tunisia,expat life in Tunisia,Questions about living in your country ahead of my 3 month visit,"Hi /r/Tunisia! I will be staying in Tunis for the next three months for a summer job and I am incredibly excited. However, this will be my first time in your beautiful country or even in Africa, which is why I have some questions ahead of my visit that I would appreciate answers to :) 

1. What is the level of English proficiency amongst Tunisians (especially in Tunis)? I know that Arabic and French are the two main languages whilst English is less commonly know, but as someone with no Arabic knowledge and very basic French proficiency, will I be able to survive just on speaking English around the capital or should I revise some basic French phrases?
 
2. Phone Sim Card: Any suggestions as to which provider I should go with, what plan is the best value for money? I definitely need 3G internet access always, so I need a plan with lots or even unlimited data as well as good reliable coverage. 

3. Safety concerns: I've been reassured several times by my employers that the country and city is safe to visit, but I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you have tips about things that I shouldn't do, places I shouldn't visit etc.?

4. The summer heat: how do you guys stay cool? I see that the temperatures can reach above 40 degree celsius, and as someone who has lived in western Europe most of my life, that is really making nervous that I won't be able to stand the heat. Are most buildings air conditioned? Any tips about how to sleep at night, (which I am most worried about)?
5. This might be a somewhat weird question, but what do Tunisians think of Chinese people (I am Chinese). Do people in the capital see many Chinese people (i'm thinking tourists). Will I get looks and stares around the city if I just go on a jog or a walk alone? 

Thank you for reading this long post! Any advice/tips/suggestions that are not related to the questions above would also be appreciated (must-dos, places to eat, things to try etc) :) ","I'll try to answer some of your questions
**1.** I suggest sharpening your French, Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) won't really do much for you anyways
**3.** The more poor a place looks the more reason you should stay away
**4.** At night it gets cooler not chilly but cool enough to let you sleep at night it might get getting used to you'll manage

I am living outside of Tunisia (I am not tunisian nor arabic) and met a tunisian girl here. We went out a few times and now we are together. She is very kind and sweet.  
She lived in Tunisia all her life, never left the country until she came here to work.  
  
 I take care of her, but she also does her best to return the favor (for example when we spent the weekend together she cooked while I had to do some work I could not finish else). She takes a look at the small details, we went out on a bazar together, I looked at something and thought about buying a new purse and sportsbag. She said don't buy it, it's not worth the price. Guess what? 3 days later she gifted me a new purse and a relatively expensive brand sportsbag (costed her probably more than 10% of her monthly salary). She doesen't ask for much, she is happy when she spends time with me, even if it is just tea or watching a movie at my home. 

For me this is completely new since I only dated ""westernized"" women before (ukranians, belarussians, germans, turkish, etc).

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,"45% of Tunisian want to get out, the rest WHY do you want to stay","Tunisia is at a breaking point, and the statistics don’t lie—45% of the population wants to leave. But for those who choose to stay, I have to ask: Why? Here’s why most people are desperate to get out:

1. Economic Collapse
The Tunisian dinar has plummeted in value, inflation is sky-high, and job opportunities are scarce. Young professionals, especially engineers and doctors, are leaving in droves because they can earn more in Europe, even in low-skilled jobs. It’s hard to see hope when your degree doesn’t get you anywhere at home.


2. Lack of Infrastructure and Resources
The healthcare system is underfunded and failing, public services are inefficient, and even simple administrative tasks are a nightmare of red tape. Those who can afford it are opting for private healthcare, but for most Tunisians, medical care is increasingly out of reach.


3. Social and Political Disillusionment
After the revolution, hopes for a better Tunisia were high, but many now feel that the political leadership has failed to deliver. Corruption, poor governance, and a lack of tangible reforms are driving people to believe that Tunisia can’t change. This sentiment is especially strong among the youth, who see no future for themselves in a stagnating country.


4. Brain Drain
A significant number of the country's best and brightest—engineers, doctors, skilled professionals—are being lured away by better prospects abroad. This brain drain leaves Tunisia with fewer skilled workers to improve its situation, creating a vicious cycle of underdevelopment.


5. Quality of Life
The cost of living keeps rising, but salaries don’t. Even civil servants, once considered stable jobs, are struggling. Many professionals have families abroad sending remittances, but this isn’t sustainable. The dream of a better quality of life is pushing even those with stable jobs to leave.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,"""We deserve this"" speech, or how the oligarchs don't take responsability for their own wrongdoings","First off, two points that are important:  
\- I am myself priviledge, therefore I may be considered part of what I describe in this post, which I agree with.

I am always baffled by all these shitty sentences people in tunisia say , like ""we deserve this"" ""cha3b pril mahabech yekhdem"" ""el tounsi iheb yotkhol el jahna meghir ma i sali w i heb i koun ghni maghir men yekhdem"" and all other bullshit sentences that might sound clever, but whom are extremly stupid and condescending, just giving the impression of knowledge

""we deserve this"", referring to the state of the country, as the people did it to itself, convinently forgetting that tunisia is an oligarchy run by approximatively 500 families all around tunisia and their lackeys, whom openly use corruption, nepotism daily. Like, are we just going to ignore that ?   
These same families are the ones who were behind/took all the political decisions in Tunisia and they are the ones who took us straight to the crisis we are living. So kinda rich from them to blame the average citizen for their failures.  
I also remind you that 10 years ago we had a revolution, and that this revolution, instead of helping us, pushed us right into instability, with scandals and a parliment that looked more like a casino, so I understand why some people don't believe in Politics, because politics failed them.

""Cha3b pril ma ihbech yekdem"" and other bs about wanting to be rich without working. First, yes, everyone wish to be rich without working, that's the whole point of capitalism, No one enjoys working for working. It's also very rich coming from people that rent out houses or own dividendes in companies, whom is quite literally being rich without working. Secondly, I wish them  to be serious when they say this crap to women waking up at 5 am to work in houses and permit them to have a clean houses, before returning to their slums(because yes, some of them are slums)

Criminality is rising true from a lack of ressources yes , but also from a market. In order to sell drugs, you need people to buy them, so maybe instead of complaning of the ""criminality"" look at how our laws are repressive, how our police is repressive and corrupt.

""Niveau ta3 cha3b tayah"" YES, and WHO MADE IT THAT WAY? Echkoun eli made an education system completly  dystopic where kids have to learn 2 languages just to purse an education, where parent association are forbidden in order to ""preserve"" teachers who deliberatly extort their own students with études otherwise you have less than 10, and who destroyed the technical schools of tunisia because ""it is jboura thing""  or who unfunded public education  and created a very lucrative system of private schools whom each year cost more and more only to educate en masse toba, mohandsin and other who are fleeing the country the second they can because of how low the pays are, how shitty their working conditions are and how corrupt are the companies, private or public ' and we are talking about what is supposed to be the top of the brass. 

Who neglected since independence manatak el dekheliya for years and years? Who made some neighborhood unlivable and started blaming on migrants as if it wasn't already shitty before?

Like our lifes are shitty, some people have to QUIT eating meating because of how expensive it is, and can't find even a job because how all these problems , and you guys have the Guts to say ""we deserve it , and complain about Kais, as if the people wanted him and WEREN'T too busy not dying. Also, who stripped the revolution from the lower classes and turned it into a massive shitshow, making it even worse than Ben Ali? Because they didn't vote in an obviously rigged elections ?  

It was about time an opportunist like KS happens because of how our ruling class is. Before blaming 12 million people, Blame the ones that put us in this situation to began with. THEN, maybe then, when you will really look at Tunisia problems for what they are, and not as a way to assert class dominance by complaining about supposed lower classes wrongdoings, then maybe we can advance. Otherwise, we are doomed anyways.","Nah, I'm sure our country is failing because the people who work 12 hours a day to survive want better wages.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ghufq6/we_deserve_this_speech_or_how_the_oligarchs_dont/,"Unknown, Tunis",Inquiry,en
Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,"Coming to spend half a year in Tunisia, need your help","Hi reddit and its Tunisians!
I'm planning to come live there in Autumn for half a year or so and I immensely need your advice on a list of aspects. Huge thanks in advance.

1. Is €1000-1500 a month enough to live there including rent in a decent safe neighborhood close to the shoreline? I work online, don't need a job. I've checked numbeo.com and all of the such, but numbers still differ on different sources. My needs are: 1-2 time a week eat-out (nowhere too fancy tho); 2-bedroom (or spacious 1-bedroom) flat in a nice hood; occasional sightseeing tours etc; good unlimited internet both at home and mobile; fine products to cook at home; maybe a couple of low-cost city breaks in Paris and other nearest cheap-to-reach European cities.
2. Which city would you recommend for that? Non-conservative, not too noisy and hustling, but with some fun places to go from time to time to meet local and foreing people and do something.
3. Is Tunisian youth open to foreigners and communication? How close is the community?
4. The eternal safety question. Pov: I'm a 26 yo pale-white long-haired bloke with a couple piercings, tattoos and the such, quite informal I would say. How much attention and eyes am I about to catch? 😁 Like is it fine walking at night without worrying too much? (Assuming I live in a good area)
4.1. I may also come with my girlfriend, same questions about her + are we okay living together while not being married?
5. I see quite different rent prices on eg. reddit and mubawab, what should I expect with requirements in question 1? Fully-furnished ofc. 
6. How good is the situation with internet and mobile network? I need a very stable communication because I use video calls all the time for work. Is it possible to get a plan with unlimited data? How much is it gonna cost me? Both home and mobile, please.
7. How safe is the country in the rural areas? Like if we talk about hiking, visiting the villages, the Sahara tours and so on
8. How bad is it with the traffic and driving style and how insensible is it of me to hire a motorbike?
9. How serious is the situation with the revolution, unrests and political instability? Are the police dangerous to interact with? Is there anything like authoritarian regime or so? Maybe any topics to avoid bringing up when talking to locals?
10. Any national hobbies/interests/cultural aspects to dive in or be ready for beforehand? Like what Tunisians love and admire etc.
11. I know English is not popular there, but I can speak a little French. Is enhancing the latter enough or learning key Arabic is my only way?

Huge thanks for answering, you'll help me a ton! Any other thoughts and details are very welcome 🙃","you have too many questions im answering the first one

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,Thinking about moving back,"(Throwaway account)

Aaslema ennes lkol, 

Inchallah lkolkom labes ! It is my first post on this sub. 

So title is self explanatory but I’ll give you more context. 

I am 25 years old (soon 26), I have been living for 7 years in Paris and let’s say that career wise I have been very lucky, since graduating. 

I am in the process of joining a US crypto unicorn as head of Business Development. The position is fully remote. My total compensation package is $215K annually. So around $18K/month. I have also done well in the crypto markets and have around $400K saved in the forms of various tokens. So I am relatively upper class even in western countries standards. 

I haven’t been to Tunisia for the past 5 years now, due to mainly work and never finding the right time. I take care of my family financially so always feel pressure.

But for the past year, I have been feeling less and less good here in France. Radical changes in society in terms of more racism, more insecurity, higher cost of living, taxes… I feel like despite everything I’ll always be just « an Arab » and a foreigner. 

And in the other hand I want to spend more times with my parents (They are turning 60 this year) and family and be in a place where I am welcomed and can for exemple go to the Mosque without people viewing it as weird. 

I have many questions : How does taxation work? Should I create an offshore company in Tunisia? How does FCR actually work?

How much would I need to live a « lavish » lifestyle in Tunis : Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ? A lot people say I’m crazy to wanting to go back while others like my parents (Biased?) think it’s better and can live like a « king » here. 

Thanks 🇹🇳","u are such an inspiration man, to achieve what u achieved at 25 years old is unusual und magnificent.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,A question to Tunisin virgin men,"I (28M, currently live in France) have chosen to stay virgin and I took this decision since I was a teenager for two reasons: the first is religious and the second is the fact that I want to do it with a girl I love and that should be through marriage otherwise I would take the virginity of a girl and that would destroy her life because I knew that society is very harsh on this subject.

&#x200B;

I have been thinking about investing more time in looking for a potential partner to eventually marry her since I've been lonley since COVID and I think it's a good time to start my own family. But recently I read a BBC article   about  Hymenoplasty, or reconstruction of the hymen that claims that more than 75% Tunisian women had done this operation and I quote in french(sorry!:): "" une étude menée par une psychanalyste tunisienne estime que 20% des jeunes femmes tunisiennes seraient véritablement vierges et que 75% ""des vierges médicalement assistées"". ""

&#x200B;

Ever since, I have found this reality shocking and I have been massively discouraged by the idea of marriage. Being virgin and inexperienced I wanted to live this experience with an  inexperienced women as well , to be patient with each other till we learn our bodies and how we should do things and all of this of course with love and affection because if I only wanted sex I can afford top tier escorts or I can play one night stand games. What shocked me is: is it harder for women to stay virgin till a late age or am I saint in any kind (even though I have always been horny as any man in his twenties should be) have I idealized the idea of marriage ? I would much rather be with an honest partner that tells me his past experiences than doing this kind of operations (I know too that this hymn thing iss not accuratee indicator of virginity any way, I'm just interested in past experiences), I will be honest and I will tell a potential partner that I'm virgin which might upset 75% of Tunisian girls who are supposedly more experienced and which is totally fine and that is  even what  is going on here in western societies women tend to prefer experienced men. 

&#x200B;

Finally, anyone Tunisian men relate about this especially the loss of interest for getting married ? Especially the cost of wedding in Tunisia lately that costs a fortune and how risky it has become as a project (for both parties, I'm aware that experienced men tend to hate their inexperienced women in Tunisia too but that's another subject)   
PS: I don't judge Tunisian women who are not virgin, and this is not the subject, the subject is about families that will be potentially built based on lies where the man is inexperienced and the women lied about her past experiences.  
Girls who want to comment are welcome too but I repeat I don't mean to insult women or to make men look like angels.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,My thoughts on Canada as someone who has lived there for almost a decade,"There’s a lot of confusion about Canada as it’s becoming super popular right now (because of increased immigration targets), so I figured I’d clear up some confusion as someone who lived in Canada for almost a decade and know different provinces.

There’s a lot of stuff I want to tell people if they ask me for advice about moving to Canada but I refrain from saying everything because they want to hear what they like to hear otherwise they think I somehow have something against them personally.. so this is going to sound blunt but in my opinion it’s the unfiltered truth

# Canada is two countries dressed up as one

Canada has a federal system, meaning that every province in Canada controls a subset of areas, most notably things around rent/healthcare/schooling so things vary wildly between provinces including even taxes. There’s 4 main provinces where most Canadians live: Ontario (38% of population, 38% of GDP/economy), Quebec (22% of population, 20% of GDP), British Columbia (13% of population, 14% of GDP), Alberta (11% of population, 15% of GDP). However, most provinces are similar and create laws that are close to each other to make things smoother. For example, nearly all provinces have 19 as the drinking age, the same maximum interest rate you can charge…etc 

Quebec, however, is so different from the rest it can almost be its own country. It’s the only province allowed to collect its own taxes, run its own retirement program, control its own immigration. It’s also the only majority French speaking province and has very specific laws about this because they care a lot about French. It even has a different approach to housing making housing much cheaper in Quebec than anywhere in Canada (for example rent in Montreal which is one of Canada’s biggest cities is much cheaper than even small cities in Ontario not even Toronto) but Quebec also has higher taxes for the average person (and not much different for high incomers).

Quebec generally has lower economic opporurtinities compared to the other provinces (mostly due to it isolating itself with French) and pays lower salaries on higher average taxes. At the same time, it’s cheaper than the other main provinces in almost all aspects but especially in housing (Alberta being a bit similar there). 

Now onto more controversial things, Quebecois have their own distinct culture and history to the point that Quebec wanted to leave Canada which they almost did a couple of times. If you ever visit Quebec and another province, you'll notice immediately that they feel like different countries from laws to architecture to people's attitudes. While Alberta is the most right wing province, Quebec is by far the most racist and especially when it comes to muslims. It's more similar to France in this aspect (so trying to ban hijab, they even protested a muslim/maghrebi neighborhood…etc) while the rest of Canada, even Alberta, is much more accepting and is closer to the stereotypical image people have of a Canadian. Moreover, most people in the rest of Canada have not even heard of Tunisia (and sometimes Algeria). 

So when people talk about Canada, they should specify what province they’re talking about but much much more importantly Quebec or Rest of Canada, especially that up to 95% of Tunisians live in Quebec the last time I checked stats. Also, I’ll talk mostly about the rest of Canada because while I know Quebec quite well, I have never lived in it for more than 2 months. 

# Why are recent immigrants often unhappy

This is very subjective but based on my own observations. Immigraiton in Canada has shifted significantly, the federal government increased its immigraiton targets insanely (accepting 1m people a year for a country of 40m when it used to be 200-300k/yr). People come to Canada with very high expectations, they hear about healthcare, social and public services, the reputation of a high standard of living…etc and the reality ends up being different but people are shocked to see that because while they hear these stories about Italy/France, they don't know about Canada.

This happens because of many reasons

# Cost of living doesn’t match salaries 

With the surge of immigrants but no increase in housing built, housing costs have soared. You have to pay $3000/mo for a 1bd in Toronto right now. So did demand on a lot of stuff, not to mention the soaring prices across the world. People basically underestimate how much it takes to live in a big city in Canada.

Also, salaries are higher on average in Canada than most of the EU and of course way higher than Tunisia so people accept offers not knowing what kind of standard of living it will get them. Moreover, the kind of super fast immigraiton growth in Canada is not done in proportion with high paying jobs in Canada, so in other words Canada is bringing in immigrants mostly to work jobs that Canadians don’t want or work jobs that Canadians want but not at a salary Canadians would accept. 

Canadian companies also value Canadian experience and degrees and will pay you less or won’t hire you if you don’t have it. This is the case everywhere but especially true for Canada and is a well documented problem. People don’t have this problem nearly as much in the US or also to a lesser degree in the EU. Most people coming here will be underemployed (not unemployed, but working jobs they’re overqualified or underpaid for). This is hard to understand for immigrants coming to Canada because they compare it to countries with lower cost of living, it’s also why I hear that salaries in Canada are not that high compared to France…etc when in reality they are, it’s just that they’re high for people with Canadian degrees and experience. 

# Healthcare

Healthcare is free in Canada but it’s not easily available. You can wait for a year to find a family doctor and going to the ER for an emergency you can wait for 5 hours+. This is despite Canada spending insane amounts on healthcare, much more than Europe but the result is worse. I personally decided to fly to Tunisia next time I need something like a minor surgery.

# Taxes

Taxes are low compared to EU for the average person in Canada but they’re incredibly high for high incomers. It goes up to 55% marginal tax (i.e. what you pay for every extra dollar you earn). Being successful in Canada means you get destroyed by taxes while social services are not at the same level you’d find in high tax countries like Norway or Sweden. 

# Housing

Besides rent which I discussed, buying a house or apartment in most of Canada has become impossible. My salary is in the top 1% but it's not enough to buy the average house in Canada let alone in expensive cities in Canada. This is because housing prices soared in the last 10 years, making a lot of people who own a house much richer and creating a problem with housing affordability including higher rent.

# Would you recommend Canada? 

It depends on a million factors but to me, unless you can move to the US, Canada makes sense compared to EU if and only if you get a well paying job. Compared to staying in Tunisia, there's very few scenarios where I'd recommend not moving.

Canada is probably the best country to be in for someone looking for an average life (even compared to the US), taxes are low and the standard of living is pretty good compared to France/Italy/Spain minus the healthcare issue. 

If you want to move here on a below average salary or if you’re a very high income earner (200k+), Canada is a bad deal. On a below average salary, you’ll struggle with the basic necessities because they’re expensive here (rent, transportation, food). On a high income, you’ll pay insane taxes and won’t get much in return for it.

Finally, I hope this comes across as a balanced overview because trust me I’m not trying to push any agenda here. For example, I can’t own a house despite having a very high salary but it doesn’t mean I’m not living very comfortably and can afford anything I want and have savings. It also doesn’t mean I’m not unhappy with many things. I’m still recommending Canada for certain people even though I’m planning to leave to the US. It’s just that there’s a lot of nuance involved and I think the hardest thing to grasp for people when it comes to Canada is that it’s different from both EU and US so people who try to think of it from either perspective end up missing the mark.",Lived in Canada for 6 years (3 years in AB and 3 years in QC) and this is the MOST accurate description of Canada,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/15sxsf4/my_thoughts_on_canada_as_someone_who_has_lived/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,Update on the abandoned puppies ,"
Hello fellow Redditors,

I had posted a few days ago about the abandoned puppies I found in Tunisia and whether there would be anyone interested to adopt one of them (see thread below).

I found someone who’s going to adopt two of them in Tunisia which is great.

However now I’m looking for anyone in Tunisia who wants to care for 1 of the remaining 4 puppies in exchange for a monthly remuneration and I’d be covering the vet costs. This would be for 3-4 months until the paperwork and health checks can be finalised for adoption in europe. Anyone with some experience taking care of dogs and wanting to help?

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,How to feel safe again?,"Hello

I don't know if I'm overthinking a lot or if it's being too much insecure or something like that but every time I see thugs (Cloucharat, I don't know how to write it in French) I worry about being attacked by them for whatever reason or no reason at all, I get easily scared and I completely don't know how to deal with being attacked by a thug.

Correct me if I'm wrong but these ""cloucharat"" feel like an exclusive Tunisian phenomenon, They have characteristics that I don't see in thugs from other countries, They are very unpredictable, They very violent and have zero empathy for people which basically makes their characters a mix of psychopath and sociopath, Strangely they attract hot girls and sometimes even succeed in life as if people don't care about their wrongdoing, They are naive, dumb and even mentally ill but they are also short tempered and will get angry to the smallest thing, They care a lot about masculinity and being a ""rajel"" but they have no problem with doing crimes and they are even proud of it, They idolize Latin/South American gangs and cartels and impoverished African Americans/Black culture, They are hypocrites (They will post pro Palestine or mourn their deceased parent but they don't have problem destroying people's lives and even killing people), malicious and cunning like snakes (What little braincells they have will be used only when they see an opportunity to rob someone for example they'll lure a victim to a place where they can attack/rob him) and the list goes on and on...

I know that this kinda seems like a stereotype to paint them like that but it is based on my experience as someone who lives in bad neighborhood, goes through bad neighborhoods on a daily basis, been attacked multiple times and mugged twice and simply had to deal with a ton of shitty situation that involves ""cloucharat"". 

I kinda have a pessimistic worldview, That Tunisians in general are accepting of ""cloucharat"" to some extent especially if they have a family member or friend who's like that, I see these thugs having GFs and eventually getting married, I see people treating them nicely and believe or not, I know one or two who actually got to TV channels multiple times as if they are nice people and people of culture, On TV channels like Elhiwar Ettounsi and Carthage plus, Like imagine thugs being good people, So I feel worthless since I'm not a thug myself and I feel like an outcast.

But my main concern is my safety, I don't have a problem with being rejected by Tunisian society but I just want to live. I'll be completely honest, I feel hopeless, defenseless and scared, I don't know what I would do If I get attacked and I constantly feel that it might happen one day, I feel weak and unable to defend myself and I don't have hope for getting help from Police or anyone else. Tunisia to me is literally a ""غابة"" and I don't know if I can keep surviving. But it shocks me to see people living their normal lives and not afraid of anything, I see men and women walking the streets while holding their phones in bad neighborhoods and not scared of mugging, I see people riding their scooters and not afraid of anyone who might steal it from them, people walk at night not afraid of being attacked suddenly, they confidently walk close to the scaring looking thugs and so I have a strong feeling of ""إغتراب"", Like I don't belong here and that something about me attracts the attention of thugs.

I'm sorry if I wrote this post too long or If I'm being a bit vague, I just find it difficult to express myself in this subject because I'm very emotional about it and I really don't know how to handle my situation, To give you an idea about me, I rarely take my phone outside the house but when I do, I hide it inside a small bag that I hide underneath my clothes and I put in my pocket a decoy phone in case I get mugged and the phone I would take outside is not my main phone, I bought the cheapest used smartphone I could find which costed me 30 dinars so I can minimize the losses, I also take with me a metal chain in case I need it, I don't know how to fight and I'm weak but I felt that I must have any kind of weapon. I'm going to go the extra mile and buy a small/micro bodycamera that I would hang on my clothes and have it recording as long as I'm outside and this doesn't feel enough to me, I'm literally thinking about wearing a bodyarmor, getting a tazer/electrical shock, a pepper spray and so on...

Am I being extreme about this ? How do you guys live your lives feeling safe ? How can someone be able to defend himself ? I think I should stop at these questions since this is getting too long, I just hope that you are able to understand what I'm saying, I really need advices.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,Can Someone Living Abroad and Visiting Tunisia Soon Help ,"Hello, I just wanted to ask if someone living abroad could help me with something.

I’ve been talking to various Facebook and Instagram pages that offer to ship Shein orders to Tunisia, but they charge a very high percentage for themselves. For example, one of them asked for 16 DT to ship an item that costs 1.25 euros, which seems pretty expensive and unreasonable given Shein’s lower quality.

Don’t get me wrong—I know Shein isn’t great, and I can find better things elsewhere. It’s just that they have some cute items, and I’m not ordering anything extravagant. My whole order is only 12.33 euros, and it consists of phone cases, an AirPod case, and three necklaces.

So, I wanted to know if I can trust someone living abroad to place the order for me, and I’ll pay them back when they arrive in Tunisia and give me the items.

- Is it free? if not how much would it cost?
- What clinic would you recommend for the safest possible abortion in Tunis the capital?

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,TIL - France massacred Tunisian civilians during the Algerian Independence war,"During the Algerian War for Independence, the French bombed the town of [Sakiet Sidi Youssef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakiet_Sidi_Youssef) in Tunisia, believing that FLN troops were hiding there. Indeed, Algerian freedom fighters regularly crossed the border and attacked French positions from inside Tunisia, shooting military planes out of the sky. Tunisia was at the time officially neutral, but supported their Algerian brothers nonetheless and allowed them in. The French wanted this to stop and decided to bomb Tunisians, both to crush their spirits, and to send a message that Algerian troops hiding in Tunisia will be targeted, and that Tunisia should expel them in order to avoid further bombings.

Thus, in February 8th of 1958, French planes illegally flew above Tunisian soil and flattened the town to ruble, leaving only devastation and death. Nothing was spared, even the school full of children attending their morning classes was targeted, and this bombing ended up costing the lives of more than 70 Tunisian civilians and Algerian refugees, and injured more than 148 others. As of today, the French never apologized for this crime, and no reparations nor recognitions were given. Following this grave event, international opinion shifted against France, and both Tunisia and Morocco went on to further support Algeria, taking a hard stance that continued throughout the war, up to the Algerian independence in 1962.

I find this event really interesting, since it was the last time that the Maghreb was united, albeit against a common foe. I honestly wish we continued to support each other since then, but politics is a cold game sadly, and the French purposefully tried to divide us (it ended up working in the end). Maybe in the future we'll get over our difference and start working together again :)

Anyways, I hope that was informative!

The events of Sakiet Sidi Youssef were really horrible but if the point of your post is to unite the Maghreb.. then I would rather speak directly to the two parties of the conflict (Algerians and Moroccans).

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,Moving to Tunisia - Safety?,"Hello! I grew up in the West, but I have wanted to leave for a while because of the racism and high cost of living (I am of Pakistani origin and am Shi'a Ismaili Muslim, though am not very religious as I grew up in the west). I'm looking to move somewhere near the Mediterranean, as I enjoy the culture, people, weather, scenery, etc. and because it has a much more affordable cost of living (EDIT: I will be keeping my job and just work remotely, so I would be earning in a much  stronger currency while living there). I am just wondering about the safety in certain areas.

From what I have seen online, Tunis looks absolutely beautiful, but my government warns against visiting Tunisia because of safety issues. It says that it is dangerous because of terrorist attacks, political instability, and violence against women.

I am hesitant to fully believe what my government is saying though, as they are very biased against Islamic countries and tend to say this about all of them. I have spent a lot of time in Egypt and found it to be very safe, even though my government said the same warnings about Egypt as well.

I am hoping to hear from local people's perspectives about the safety in your country. Would it be foolish to move there? I am nearly 30 years old and would like to start a family soon, and I don't want to do that in the West because of how difficult it is for children to grow up here in racist schools, but I also want to make sure that wherever we live we would be safe, especially if I have a daughter.

P.S. - Would it be an issue that I'm Shi'a Ismali? As mentioned, I'm not very tied to my religion and would be open to learning about and practicing Sunni faith.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,First impression of Tunisia… from an outsider.,"I’m Indonesian, and I just visited Tunisia at the end of last year (which was one week ago) to visit my boyfriend’s family. Tunisia is very beautiful. The coastline? Breathtaking. The hills around Tunis that you can see from the Highway? Beautiful. The food? Amazing. The seafood? SCRUMPTIOUS. Here are some positive things I really loved:

1. People are extremely friendly:
We went to the market and bought some stuff for New Year’s Eve. At the butcher, the man asked me where I’m from and he said welcome. The fruit-veggie seller said welcome and even wanted to give me the veggies for free (I rejected, of course). The guy at the Bourguiba Museum said welcome and told me that it’s fascinating that Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. People are so friendly!
2. Amazing food scene:
I am Indonesian - I love spicy food! I think I’ve been eating so much. I love the seafood, it’s so fresh and reminds me of home. I love the sweets. The portions are also huge - this part is when my boyfriend steps in and would help finish my food!
3. Great entertainment:
Coffee shops, bars, all these things are important for me. I love how it’s very open. So much music, dancing - or even just to hang out and talk with your friends. It’s very nice to see these places all lively and crowded, especially on weekends.
4. Rich culture and history:
I went to the Museum in Bardo and in Sousse. Both museums are amazing. So much history, and as a history nerd, I was so delighted to see that they are preserved. These are the things that Tunisia, as a country, needs to protect as Tunisia has thousands of years of rich history. The guide we had in Bardo was super nice and gave us a thorough explanation on Tunisian history. 

But, here are some negative things I noticed:
1. Lack of public transportation:
See, as an Indonesian, I can’t really criticize Tunisia on this, but considering the fact that Tunisia is rather small compared to Indonesia, I think the country can do so much better.
I took the SNCFT from Sousse to Tunis. The train arrived (30 mins late), I cannot help but notice that the trains are very similar to what we used to have before a massive transformation around a decade ago.
The Tunis-Carthage airport is also chaotic. I really love the architecture inside, I find it very original, but I find it too chaotic - too many staffs, they change gates without prior notification, etc. 
This lack of public transport is then added up by another issue, which is the fact that cars are heavily taxed. My boyfriend’s mom thought that I am very rich because I have my own car in Indonesia. I am not. When I heard that my tiny, €6.5k car costs almost €8.5k in Tunisia, I was shook. How are people supposed to transport themselves if cars are very expensive but yet public transport is severely lacking?
2. Lack of digitalization:
When I asked my boyfriend if we could buy the train tickets online, he laughed. I also had to stick to cash - I’ve never handled cash, ever. In Indonesia, we pay with bank apps and e-wallet apps by scanning QR Codes. In Tunis, my card got declined 3 times - there was not even a notification that the transaction failed, which means that the card machine didn’t even work.

Negative sides aside, I had an amazing time in Tunisia. Will definitely re-visit sometime in the Summer! 3aychek!","I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip, and we hope you come visit us again.  
Yes, we have been suffering from public transportation for decades, and no one has yet found a solution (this includes the bus, the train, the metro and even Tunisair flights-planes).

However, using cards to pay is not yet a culture here, you can say that all Tunisians must have cash to shop comfortably, but we are getting better day by day (but slowly), we mostly use cards to extract cash from ATM.",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1913psr/first_impression_of_tunisia_from_an_outsider/,"Tunis, Tunis, Sousse, Carthage",General,en
Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,OPEN THE BARDO NATIONAL MUSEUM!!!!!,"The recent thing about google declaring the Bardo National Museum as permanently closed is very triggering, I mean, it has been closed for over two years now, since the dissolution of the parliament (let's call it that I suppose) and there's no date, no information, no staff you can contact about it! The social media page is dead and you can't get any information regarding its future reopening. Now, before anyone comes at me, lecturing me about how necessary and how much of a national security protective measure it is, I call bullshit. I was born and raised in this country, and lived in it for my entire life, I know exactly why the museum has been closed, and in my humble opinion, it does not justify closing it for an unknown amount of time. Solutions can come up easily, ex-parliament members are known to the public eye, they can simply be observed when visiting the museum or even escorted. They can allow visitors AND appoint police officers to patrol inside the building and/ or guard the access hall to the parliament instead of having hundreds if not thousands of them sit all day at EVERY SINGLE DAMN ROUNDABOUT in this fucking country. And this is just one of the million solutions that can be pitched and I'm pretty sure a brainstorming session can come up with a better solution. 

Now, let's talk about how important the museum is, YA TWENSA, YA AABED, the Bardo National Museum is the SECOND BIGGEST MUSEUM in Africa, emphasis on the SECOND BIGGEST, it's iconic in so many ways! It contains rare Carthaginian artefacts, THE BIGGEST MOSAIC COLLECTION IN THE WORLD, marbles and bronze statues, manuscripts from the Middle Ages, the entire place is a beautiful record of how rich and diverse Tunisia's history is, and it illustrate perfectly how Tunisian culture was built. The mosaics are absolutely breathtaking, we have Virgil's portrait, and ULYSSES AND THE SIRENS which is the ONLY piece of its kind in THE WORLD and that's just me barely scratching the surface. Bardo has the largest mosaic collection in the globe, no other museum comes matched with our collection AND THAT'S HUGE FOR US BECAUSE THE COMPETITION IS ALL OF THE MUSEUMS IN ITALY AND GREECE! Those pieces have been left for us by our artists from the antiquity FOR US TO ENJOY THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER! And nobody could take that right away from us up until then (we shall not name them), no European colonialist could ever steal enough mosaics for Tunisia to withhold a #2 collection spot, no terrorist attack could take away that museum from us! It's a huge national symbol that used to be our pride and joy. I'm an avid visitor of it and every time I remember the fact that I can't visit it anymore just shatters my heart. To asses the current situation, we have kids who have never been to their national museum, have no memory of it, tourist and visitors who never got to see it, actual Tunisians who just don't give a flying damn about it, and even worse, a government who closes it at will; well here's a hot take to the government: YOU CANT FIX A COUNTRY BY WITHHOLDING ITS HISTORY AND CULTURE FROM ITS PEOPLE! Anthropologists and biologists believe that the only thing that made humans stand out as humans and not as animals is ART and CULTURE, the first records of our history were drawn in caves using rudimentary tools and pigments, animals don't have that, HUMANS DO! 

SO TREAT YOUR POPULATION AS ANIMALS AND EXPECT THEM TO BEHAVE LIKE ANIMALS! 

We don't have much to enjoy in this country, and the closed museum not only makes matters worse, BUT IT'S THE EASIEST FUCKING THING WE CAN FIX TO MAKE THE PAIN MORE BEARABLE (noting the current problems we're facing, the food shortage, and hydraulic stress etc...). I used to visit the museum at least three times a year, if not more, I'd drag family members, friends with me, hell I'd even go alone, and walking in those walls, taking pictures, sketching from the art I could see is just so therapeutic and serene. I'd leave the museum feeling more connected to our country, and lowkey proud to be a part of it, it's just so simple and stupid but it works, and the fact that this one basic right, that doesn't cost the government a single fucking dime is held away from us, just makes my blood boil! 


PS: It has been changed on Google by the way (as of today) but the museum is still closed, they shouldn't just change the fucking label on the internet THEY SHOULD OPEN THE FUCKING MUSEUM INSTEAD!",I'm a bit out of the loop. I thought it was closed because our glorious leader closing the parlament but I thought the immaculate leader created a new puppet parlament and thus no reason for the Barda to be closed anymore.

I’m a Texan getting close to retirement. I’m thinking about selling my house here and finding a new frontier to go out to pasture. I have never been to Tunisia. It’s a glaring gap in my travels, I admit. But I’ve been to Egypt and Algeria and Italy and Morocco and almost literally every other country on the Mediterranean, so maybe I’m wrong, but I think that I have a pretty solid idea what kind of living I’d find there, I love North African/Mediterranean people, culture, architecture, food.... but especially I love the climate.

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,We need to change things in our economy or we will keep facing always the same problems.,"Hey everyone, I want to talk about what's happening in Tunisia. Our main issues stem from a struggling economy and weak currency, causing low salaries, like a minimum wage of 390 for a 40-hour week and 460 for a 48-hour week. To boost salaries, we should stop state subsidies on things like bread and sugar (except maybe oil, which makes a profit) but it still doesn't make sense for someone with a 300K car or living abroad to pay the same as someone with a Peugeot 206.

We also need to fix our deficit-ridden public companies. Many have more employees than necessary. We could expand their functions to make them more productive, or we might have to let go of some employees to cut costs and make profits. Another option is privatizing non-essential companies, like those producing cigarettes, which are in the red and costing the state money, by privitazing them the state will make money off taxes.

If we make our public companies profitable, the government will have more money. This could lead to reducing taxes, which I believe is a major cause of our current inflation. I'm proposing we follow a socio-democratic model like many European countries, with free education, healthcare, and public transport. Instead of subsidies for everyone, let's provide direct social aid to families in need.

But to make these changes, we need a bold leader at the helm, not a bunch of fools. It'll take time, but if we don't act now to change our economic structure, by voting to the right people we'll keep facing the same problems.

The blade is a single use item for hygienic reasons. Looks simple enough. The raw materials should cost nothing but once the sticker ""for medical use"" is slapped on the package the price goes way up...

Am no engineer, nor a business man, nor do I understand the rules of import export and all the crap in between. But my tiny brain says "" why doesn't one build this stuff and sell it cheaper?"" 

Can someone help me understand why dear God are we stuck? 

Those in tunisia want to leave but can't! And those abroad may want to come home but also can't or shouldn't. Am sick of being a foreigner. The bureaucracy in tunisia wants me to basically bend over before accepting my training and my own mother says stay there, it's going to hell here....

Sorry for the rant. Snuck it in there since my blood boiled writing this thread.","you see, this is a common issue called ""allowing old, corrupt and dumb men to rule the country"".

Tunisia's problems are the following :

\- incompetent people with no education are put in higher positions due to nepotism, and a healthy dose of promoting according to loyalty, not competence. and said people will always be corrupt, and try to exploit their positions.  
for instance, let's talk about the police. no offense, but the majority of people employed in the police force can't even write their own names correctly, even arabic. apart from the academy, whose graduates are generally high level officers who don't interact much with the population, the rest are mostly made up of those who barely made it to highschool. a lot never even got their BAC. this is one of the many reasons the police in tunisia tends to antagonize the people too much. in germany for instance, you need to be a university graduate to join the police, and if i remember correctly, they do 2 years of training, including a lot of ""how to de-escalate"" and ""how to deal with citizens properly"". in Tunisia sadly, the police will make your life hell, especially if it seems you are more successful than them. not everyone, but it's very rampant.  
the same thing can be applied to every field. incompetent and corrupt people are infesting everything, and they do everything in their power to sabotage anyone who takes their job seriously.

\- Tunisia is ruled by mafia families, each controlling specific sectors of the economy, and they use their influence and wealth to pass laws that protects them, and they destroy any competition before it even gets its legs off the ground. monopolies hurt the economy.

\- nobody in tunisia pays their taxes except those who work in the public sector, since the state will take what is due from their pay directly. This is one of the biggest issues that is bankrupting the country. this wouldn't pass in any civilised country. And few years ago, i can't remember if it was lawyers or doctors, but there were a lot of those in the private sector who went on a general strike when they were asked to keep an accurate count of their earnings and pay their taxes.

\- refusal to adopt new technologies, again because we have nothing but old decrepit idiots in positions of power. Tunisia is one of only 2 countries on the planet that doesn't allow Paypal for example, and if it is found out you have an account, you could go to jail for money laundering. we also have a similar issue with every administration sticking to papers and ink instead of digitilising. this is not only less efficient, but also allows for corruption to continue expanding, since its kinda harder to cheat a digital system. there was a funny photo circulating a while back when a commuty from i think the european bank for reconstruction and development and representatives from the tunisian central bank. the european commuty was made from young people, 30s or 40s, and they were all equipped with tablets and laptops to do all their work, while the tunisian team was just old men in their 60s with a mountain of papers all over the table. it's just embarassing.

\- mistreatment of talented people, which is causing a massive braindrain : the nation spend a lot of money on educating high level workers, like doctors and engineers, only for them to leave the country the first chance they get because the country keeps mistreating them (hellish bureaucracy, people with hardly any education bossing you around and insulting you on a daily basis etc). one of my relative told me this year that he went to a hospital at night in france, and nearly the entire medical team working nightshift was made of tunisians. also most engineers in IT would leave tunisia after working just 2 or so years.

we could go on for days, but if i'm being honest, there is no way to fix this country. the older generation is too corrupt and still has a strong hold on power, and we have no future since the minds of the newer generation have been corrupted by social media and the propaganda spreading through tunisian tv dramas.

at this point what we need is a hard reset, and especially ban everyone above the age of 60 from having any position of power. like, no job would accept someone of that age because we have scientific proof that neither their physical nor their mental health allow it, yet we allow them to rule us and decide our future",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/17m3z26/fire_water_and_industry_tunisia_and_its_failing/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,cost of living in Tunisia,The EU/IMF vs. Other Approaches: A Subjective Evaluation of What I Believe to Be True,"Well, I saw the poll request about \[ [What approach do you guys think is the most beneficial for tunisians?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/12ye0y1/what_approach_do_you_guys_think_is_the_most/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \] and I was late getting to the party, so I haven't had the chance to discuss it with you guys since I feel driven to do so

So, without any further intros, let's get straight to the point.

In order to determine which approach to stick with, we must first understand the nature of the challenges we are dealing with.

Tunisia's economic growth has been limited by [exploitative entities](https://kapitalis.com/anbaa-tounes/2019/07/10/%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84/), which can take various forms, starting with corruption and authoritarianism, and tend to concentrate money and power in the hands of a select few at the expense of the rest of the population, causing Tunisia to struggle with a lack of innovation and entrepreneurship, leading to a negative impact on productivity and causing living standards to fall.

# Okay, now we're getting into the meat of the matter.

&#x200B;

1- A market that isn't free :

* Public ownership of major industries
* Government control of production levels and distribution quotas
* Government control of prices and salaries

2- Inefficient resource distribution: A non-free market may lead to inefficient resource distribution since the government may not have correct information about consumer wants and preferences so it may decide to distribute resources inefficiently.

3- Lack of incentives: Because there is no reward for working hard, innovating, and taking risks in Tunisia, there may be little motivation for people and companies to accomplish these things.

4- Lack of credit accessibility: The majority of Tunisians do not have access to credit, which might restrict their capacity to launch enterprises or make investments in useful assets. Traditional banks sometimes refuse to lend to clients due to their lack of collateral or inconsistent income. Microfinance organizations, which provide modest loans to people who would not otherwise have access to credit, have arisen as a potential remedy for this issue, yet in Tunsia there ain't no such thing as that.

5- High transaction costs: Most Tunisians often face high transaction charges while using financial services, such as making deposits or withdrawals from a bank account. This might make it difficult or costly to save money or obtain financial services.

Now the question consists of which approach will allow us to address each of these problems in the future?

# Well, here's what I believe to be true:

The IMF typically recommends a combination of fiscal and monetary policies aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability, structural reforms to improve market functioning and productivity, and measures to strengthen the financial sector and promote sustainable debt management.

1. Fiscal consolidation: This involves measures to reduce government spending and/or increase revenue in order to reduce budget deficits and stabilize public debt.
2. Monetary policy: The IMF may recommend changes to a country's monetary policy, such as adjusting interest rates or exchange rates, to help stabilize inflation and promote economic growth.
3. Structural reforms: These can include measures to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy, such as privatization of state-owned enterprises, labor market reforms, or improvements in infrastructure.
4. Financial sector reforms: These can include measures to strengthen banking regulation and supervision, improve the functioning of financial markets, and promote financial stability.

Well, what I suggested may be debatable, but as I previously said, that is what I believe to be true.",No top comment,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/12ys5xr/the_euimf_vs_other_approaches_a_subjective/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,"We have built a villa in Hammamet, now what ?","Aslema dear Tunisians.

French M35 married to a Tunisian F32 from Hammamet (born and raised). We live in Europe. 

After our wedding last year, we have decided to seize the opportunity to build a nice house (I call it villa) on a piece of land which belonged to my wife.

The villa is now finished, nice location about 1-2km from the city center and the sea.

The reasons we have built the villa :
- our future kid(s) will have a connection with Tunisia 
- we can go there with friends / family to escape the cold 
- we had the land, why not using it ?
- we had cash available (we paid 100% of it)

Now my enquiries. I am aware we are privileged, but this could end if something happened. In that case, we would sell the villa, as it’s not a necessity, it’s a luxury. 

•Do you know if the real estate is okish nowadays? I’m really concerned about the political situation. No one wants to buy / rent a villa when the country is upset about election or water supply. 
•Also, would a tunisian family would be keen to rent / buy such a villa ? Or is it more a foreigner thing ? My Tunisian family in law doesn’t do it, they only build for themselves and that’s it.
•if we had to sell in local currency, I wouldn’t know how to convert it, I have a feeling it would be problematic ?

I know we should have thought about it beforehand, but anyhow the villa is there now, and we can enjoy it.

Any similar experience or advice regarding this matter would be appreciated!","People from Tunisia and tourists from neighboring countries love Hammamet . I believe you can easily find buyers or rent compared to other random regions. Housing prices are always on the rise here in Tunisia. As long as your house is in good condition and built following the code then you shouldn't have any problems. 

If you want to make money out of it, you can contact a real estate agency to help you find suitable people to rent it during the time you're abroad. Or your wife can ask a family member or a well known trusty person that can manage the estate for you and use it as a ""maison d'hôtes"" where people reserve the villa for a few days at a time (can be families, or students gathering for club events, or work staff gathering for work related events, or airbnb ... ) (especially if the villa is really nice, accessible and has a great view). it's better (security wise) to keep the house occupied with people than have it closed for a long period of time.

As for the political/electoral situation , it most likely won't effect the demand on housing.

As for the water situation, you can ask for a permit to dig a well and you can install tanks to gather rain water or to store the city water in the tank for if and when the water is suddenly cut you would use the water from the tank to wash off the shampoo from your hair :p it's common here just tell your wife to ask around and they'll help her purchase and install it. I don't know about the legality of it tho so I recommend she asks her family and neighbors first. Also, i think it would be a good idea to install solar panels too. 

As for the selling in local currency thing, I don't exactly understand the point, but I think maybe you meant that if for example you sold the villa for 300k tunisian dinars, you're wondering how you would convert such big sum of money  to 100k euros and take it with you to france ?? I think there are laws about traveling with big sums of money and converting currency . but you should be fine as long as you have proof of the source of the money (the contract of sale ) and declared it to the proper authority (one example would be when traveling by plane there is a limit on what amount of money you're allowed to take with you but if it surpasses that limit you have to declare it to the douane or something). I think you can call your bank to inquire about the procedure just to understand and get it off your mind. maybe also contact a tunisian lawyer and they can advise you and reassure you about the situation and the right way to proceed. 

Hammamet is a lovely place and its people are really nice. I hope you end up loving this decision and your kids and grandkids will be thankfull for the investment.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fgi98d/we_have_built_a_villa_in_hammamet_now_what/,"Hammamet, Tunis, Hammamet",General,en

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,"My Experience with AIESEC: Both as a Member and as Someone Who Went Abroad Through Them

","Hi everyone,

As mentioned in the title, I’m here to share my full experience with AIESEC—both as a member and as someone who participated in their program abroad. My goal is to help you make an informed decision before engaging with them.

# As a Professional

Last year, I decided to go abroad with AIESEC for a market research position in Istanbul starting in January 2024. Here’s a breakdown of my journey:

* **Initial Process**: I had interviews with both AIESEC Tunisia and Istanbul. After being accepted, I paid an initiation fee of **230 TND** for the opportunity.
* **Expenses**: Beyond the initiation fee, here’s a breakdown of the other costs I incurred:
   * **Flight ticket**: 700 TND
   * **Rent contract fees (notarized)**: 400 TND
   * **Real estate agent fees**: 400 TND
   * **Monthly rent**: 800 TND
   * **Deposit fees**: 800 TND
   * **Residence permit fees**: 800 TND
   * **Insurance for residency process**: Additional cost.
   * **Visa processing expenses**: I had to travel to the capital for this, which wasn’t necessary since Turkey allows 3 months of visa-free travel. You can handle visa status changes directly in Turkey—don’t let them misguide you and waste your money.

**Total: A LOT more than expected due to hidden costs AIESEC Istanbul never disclosed.**

* **The Job**: Upon arriving, I discovered that the job description didn’t match reality. I felt stuck in a poorly managed role that was completely different from what was promised. Despite pushing through for 3 months, the company terminated my contract due to “lack of performance”—even though they themselves failed to honor the contract’s terms.
* **AIESEC’s Response**: I contacted AIESEC Tunisia, Istanbul, and their international department. None of them offered a logical solution. Instead, they proposed a new position as a graphic designer in another state—requiring me to pay *again* for new contract fees, real estate agent fees, and other relocation costs. After everything I had already spent, I couldn’t afford to start over, so I treated the trip as a vacation and returned home.

# As a Member

Being a member of AIESEC was another disappointment. Here’s what I experienced:

* The team was poorly organized and overly focused on social events. They scheduled conferences every 3 months, each costing around **150 TND** with **zero added value**.
* They pressured members to buy their merchandise, attend events, and dedicate excessive time (up to 4 meetings a week) to discuss things that felt unproductive.
* The entire experience was unprofessional, and the environment felt like a group of aimless kids rather than a serious organization.

# My Takeaway

Whether as a professional or a member, AIESEC offered me **zero added value**. They were careless, disorganized, and didn’t provide support when issues arose.

This is just my personal experience. If you’ve had a different one, feel free to share. But if you’re considering joining AIESEC, I hope this post helps you make an informed choice.",Back in my time AIESEC was known to be a dating space more than an association and I guess that haven't changed because they milk you dry ,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1h5yvf7/my_experience_with_aiesec_both_as_a_member_and_as/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,Options for Investing in Tunisia or Abroad,"Options I know:

**1. Real Estate:** Real estate seems unpromising. I’d probably struggle to resell a property, and renting a house rarely covers more than 5% of the property price annually. Considering that last year’s inflation was about 9% and this year it’s around 6.7%, it doesn’t seem like a good option.

**2. Zitoun (Olive Farming):** Even though olive oil prices are very low this year, the cost of land with olive trees is still insanely high. Plus, the spike in olive oil prices last year was mainly because of a drought that hit much of Southern Europe.

**3. Stock Market (Tunisian Valuers or SIVAC):** From what I’ve heard, the Tunisian stock market mostly barely keeps up with inflation. So, I’d be risking my money for almost no real gains. For example, last year, inflation was 9%, while most stocks offered dividends between 2% and 5%, and growth rates were around 3%.

**4. Gold:** I’m not sure if it’s legal to buy and sell significant amounts of gold. Even if it is, protecting it is tricky. Storing it at home seems risky—telling your wife or mother could unintentionally turn it into a life-threatening secret. Storing it in a bank vault sounds better, but it comes with fees, no insurance, and the hassle of verifying and keeping original invoices to resell without raising suspicions of money laundering.",No top comment,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1guiknn/options_for_investing_in_tunisia_or_abroad/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,Buying a House in Tunisia to Reconnect with My Roots?,"Hello everyone, dear Tunisians,

Let me quickly explain my situation. I was born in France to Tunisian parents. I’ve grown up somewhat disconnected from my culture (for example, I don’t speak Arabic, I understand Tunisian but not very well). I’ve been to Tunisia about ten times (I’m in my thirties), and family conflicts have been tough. My parents used to send half of their salaries back home, but it was never enough, and they eventually stopped going.

Our luggage was searched, our gifts were never appreciated (for instance, bringing a PlayStation 2 in the 2000s, Nike shoes, and other gifts I couldn’t even afford for myself), and my father’s land was literally taken over.

But… I miss Tunisia a lot, and I know the country is struggling. It’s not a calm and peaceful oasis, but I miss it terribly. I work in IT in France, and I’d like to reconnect with my country of origin, without involving the family. They don’t have the right to take Tunisia away from us.

Many people tell me it’s a bad idea, except for my mother, who is moved by my decision and suggests buying something around Bizerte.

When I say buy, I’m not talking about an overly expensive villa, just four walls to enjoy the country for a few weeks. I don’t want to be a parasite buying a big house, just trying to be Tunisian among Tunisians.

What do you think of this idea? I often hear about real estate scams—is it safe to buy property in Tunisia? I’ve also heard about the risk of expropriation.

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,Growing the economy by attracting western retirees: Why not?,"Advanced economies (EU, CA/UK/AUS, Japan) have a very serious retirement problem. There's too many retirees and not many younger people to support them, this is not only by far the biggest problem for them but also will get way worse very soon as the most populous age range of people in most of these countries is retiring in the next few years.

I think this can be a huge win-win situation for a country like Tunisia. Let's say we get 500k retirees, each spending 20k USD/yr which is not enough to live in most advanced countries while at the same time a very comfortable life in Tunisia. That's not only 10 billion dollars of foreign currency coming to Tunisia every year (half of Tunisia's total exports) but we can tax it at a very reasonable 20% and get 2b/yr which is more than 10% of the government's budget. That money can be used to fund infrastructure (you know.. if we had a reasonable government) which will help sustain the extra people but at the same time help grow the economy. Retirees also won't have children so there wouldn't be an issue long term with integration and all the hard to solve issues that come with normal immigration.

On the other hand, you might think this will increase inflation. We can solve that to a large extent. First of all, the influx of foreign currency helps Tunisia counter the huge part of inflation that's external to us. But if we eliminate subsidies, most prices won't increase with local demand because a lot of our biggest issues are things we import and moving demand from a country to another doesn't change that. For things that can increase such as rent and real estate, we can tie this program or visa to buying or renting newly built properties targeted towards this program. That way it will shelter Tunisians from that inflation while boosting the construction industry.

You might think how would we attract such people? One of the biggest problems western countries have is the lack of doctors to help with this aging population. In Tunisia, we have the reverse problem (sort of), so instead of having our doctors leave to those countries to help with the aging crisis and at the same time benefit those countries, they can stay in Tunisia and get paid much more from the influx of retirees. Additionally, Tunisia has better weather than most of these countries (I'll admit the extreme heat might be a problem) and is close to the EU so they can visit easily or get whatever needs they have. Plus this is something that those countries will help with instead of oppose because it helps reduce pressure on their social programs which is wrecking their economies.

Obviously, this is all theoretical and this government will never do something like this because of ideological reasons... but it's food for thought",This is such a good idea.

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,Tunisians abroad who bought a house/apartment in Tunisia: how was your experience?,"I thought about this a few times and decided it’s not worth it but I’m reconsidering it for the following reasons in order of importance:
- I think getting a loan in Dinars even at 9% interest is likely to become interest free in dollars. For example, if I borrow 100k tnd I’ll pay around 250k tnd total after interest over 25 years. If the dinar weakens by 150% (so 1 usd = 7.5dt) I’ll pay the equivalent of the original 100k tnd today which means it’s an interest free loan. I know people will find this controversial and I don’t want Tunisia to fail but in my opinion there’s 90% chance that will happen in the next 3 years not even 25y. Either it will drop naturally after the president takes over the central bank and uses up reserves or it will drop when another president has to accept floating the dinar as part of a loan agreement. 
- I strongly believe that real estate in Tunisia is or will be undervalued. It’s a closed economy so only Tunisians can buy and Tunisians are and will be struggling. It doesn’t seem like housing prices are going up with inflation in Tunisia because people can’t buy anymore. So because I expect there to be hyperinflation in Tunisia soon, it might make sense to buy low 
- I haven’t found a use for dinars and I can’t take them out. I don’t have much but every time I give someone money for urgent reasons it becomes a sensitive issue and I’m tired of explaining I don’t want dinars even if they give me back double. I might as well buy a modest place for like 200-300k and put any dinars towards the loan for it
- I have plans (but not entirely sure) to work remotely for 2-3 months per year from Tunisia.
- I don’t plan to retire in Tunisia but I guess it will be nice to have that option in case things go wrong especially that I have to save millions to retire where I live so having a house in Tunisia I can retire in can reduce stress 


What do you think? Who has done this and how was your experience?","I do not have that experience but I would say that your analysis is solid.

I have a small remark though. Ignoring your home bias (you are Tunsian and hence you are not talking about buying somewhere else), you are investing in a country, where you are betting that the economy is most likely going to collapse. In case that happens, are you sure the appartement will be worth the dollars you spent on it after a couple of years? Maybe it will be an appartement where you have no stable access to electricity for example, which btw is the case in Lebanon",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/143hsip/tunisians_abroad_who_bought_a_houseapartment_in/,"Tunis, Tunis",Inquiry,en

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,On what problems should we FOCUS nowadays in Tunisia?,"&#x200B;

Here we are on the first post-referendum day, and I thought it would be interesting for everyone to come up with a reflection, take a step back, and imagine a positive path for the country in an ideal scenario, although in practice, it's unlikely to succeed. To tell the truth, myself, I barely followed the news concerning the referendum. All that I did was to read diagonally the text of constitution submitted without really having previous references to be able to cast an enough relevant critical eye. I am totally unaware of whether the new separation of powers only foreshadows excesses, the why and how a certain number of people agree that the parliamentary system was dysfunctional. I don't know neither how this new constitution is supposed to grant sovereignty to the people. But never mind.

In short, as you'd've understood, I am completely outside of all this for the moment, and I reserve the right to conduct in-depth research a posteriori to form a solid opinion on the situation. Whether you voted yes or no, whether you boycotted the referendum, or whether you think it was rigged, I invite you to put that aside for a moment, and try to think about this question: What are the work axes to prioritize these days?

By this, I'm thinking above all of the economic methods (the type of market to adopt, the priority areas of development (like, real estate, agriculture, etc.), local short circuits, imports/exports, etc. ..), to the role of young people within the national project, to the orientation chosen in all that concerns development, the fields of innovation (as tiny as they are (computing, medicine, research, engineering, programming, artificial intelligence ), etc...

What should be identified and labeled as a vector of unemployment and precariousness of the ""zaweli"" in Tunisia. Without forgetting the case of the forgotten territories of the republic, namely the West coast (Kasserine, Le Kef...) and others like Sidi Bouzid, Kebili, Tataouine.

&#x200B;

In your reflection, by way of example, if you were to cite education, try an approach of the type: What are the dysfunctions of the current education system. What should we change? Is it really relevant to force education to a certain extent when many children from poor territories are hastily taken out of school to help their parents? What is the place of Tunisia in a world where innovation, internet, programming etc. are gaining ground in many countries, often regardless of their level of development (Nigeria, India, etc.)

If you are talking about diplomacy, avoid giving answers of the type: Fares USAbigot or Abdelweheb Vladimirov... Instead, prefer the diplomatic philosophy to adopt in trade, the geographical areas to turn to, the case of pan-Arabism, etc. ... You can of course criticize foreign powers that do a lot of lobbying like Qatar for example, but make sure that this is only a minor part of your thinking.

&#x200B;

And finally avoid talking too much about the separation of powers. Here, it is not so much the levers/tools that we seek to question, but rather the philosophy of development and reconstruction to be expected, and to hope for.

You can obviously address social issues, but avoid dwelling too much on the relationship of society to religion: I think we are in an in-between that kinda satisfies both secular and religious, whereas we are not on the verge of becoming a caliphate, just as much as a future Western society. Even if tunisian people have gained a lot of maturity on this subject, the fact remains that tackling this kind of thing strongly obscures much more serious and important problems.

There you go ! Tell us what you have on your heart, your hopes, and your ideal vision of the Tunisian future. Be respectful of differing opinions, but feel free to challenge ideas civically.

À vos claviers !

And God Bless Tunisia.","I don't really have a detailed or specific opinion but I think a lot of time, effort and thought should be put into building strong and modern institutions.

Tunisia,real estate in Tunisia,A comparison between the tunisian and egyptian labour movement in the context of the arab spring,"The differing natures of the Egyptian and Tunisian labour movements simultaneously contributed to the different outcomes of their 2011 revolutions and are indicative of the societies those labour movements and revolutions came out of, thus helping to explain their divergent outcomes.

The Egyptian Trade Union Federation was founded in 1957, and became the only legal trade union, under Nasser’s state. The basis of this was the provision of job security and other economic benefits like a share in the net profit and social welfare programmes in exchange for political quietism and subordination, in order to maintain state control over the labour movement. 

This social contract broke down from the 80’s onwards as the ETUF maintained a monopoly over worker’s representation while retracting the benefits, the latter of which was part of a larger liberalizing trend in the region. 

>Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Plans (ERSAP) and agreements with the US, EU, WTO, IMF, and the World Bank within the region from the 1980s onwards included lowering custom tariffs and taxes on imports; opening up markets to foreign investments in telecommunication, the financial sector, transport, and energy; privatizing public sector companies and deregulating the labour market (lowering minimum wages, ending severance pay, making hiring and firing more flexible); and liberalizing real estate. These measures aimed to transform the state-led import substitution economies of the 1960s into export-oriented economies based on private foreign and local investment and deregularized cheap labour. ^1

In contrast, the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT, its French acronym) was founded in 1946, 10 years before Tunisia’s independence, took part in the independence of Tunisia, and thus was afforded a certain level of autonomy. It went through periods of collaboration and antagonism with the state, with the rank and file sometimes successfully pulling it in the direction of militancy. 

>This in turn guaranteed it a certain level of autonomy in the following authoritarian rule of Tunisia’s first president Habib Bourguiba, who was reliant on the UGTT to consolidate regime legitimacy. Under Bourguiba, the union was inconsistent in its cooperation or confrontation with the regime. The 1960s saw a period of relative stability and collaboration, yet throughout the 1970s – most notably the 1978 general strike – and 1980s the union militantly opposed attempts to implement IMF-back neoliberal economic reforms. This became a distinctive feature of the UGTT, that unlike other trade unions in the Arab world it never fully integrated into the state apparatus. Instead, it maintained two duel – albeit ambiguous – positions: a bureaucracy and leadership that was most often complicit with the state, but more significantly, a tendency to fall on the side of the workers and activists when attempts to resist the ruling power put pressure on the union leadership in times of crisis. ^2

There were dissidents in both the ETUF and the UGTT, but the Tunisian ones are predicably stronger. 

Despite the subordination of the ETUF to the state, the 2000s saw increased militancy from Egyptian workers outside the confines of the federation as a result of reforms like law 203 (accepted by the ETUF) in 1991, which put 314 public enterprises for sale. By 1999, 137 were sold. The ETUF further discredited itself by the acceptance of labour law 12 of 2003, “which replaced previous fixed contracts with flexible, temporary contracts”. ^1 

With this in the background, December 2006 was a significant juncture, where workers at the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company (employing 25k) went on strike prompted by a pay dispute, “when, for the first time since the social contract [of 1957], the strike became the main instrument of resistance in Egypt.” ^1 Workers demanded the impeachment of local union officials. ^3 This was followed by a subsequent phase of labour struggle where strikes were more frequent, longer in duration, and more widespread. As time went on, and demands were refused, demands that were originally just economic (increasing minimum wage) became more political, focused on the general economic policy of the government and boycotting the ETUF in favour of organizing independent trade unions. In 2009, tax officials left the ETUF to form their own union, and were followed in 2010 by public transport workers, teachers, and health technicians as well as pensioners. 
In Tunisia, the UGTT “maintained an ‘unstable cohabitation between a neutralized leadership and an uncontrolled base’”. ^1 While many of the higher bureaucracy were coopted by the state, the regional and local cadres were more radical and connected to the rank and file. This is best seen during the Gafsa rebellion in 2008, a declining phosphate mining area in the interior of the country. The Gafsa Mining Company, the main employer in the area, had been firing many workers over the years with unemployment reaching 20-39% and 40% of people below the poverty line. Sit-ins, demonstrations, marches, and clashes lasted for six months. 

This rebellion failed, but the union activists had learned from the mistake of remaining isolated in 2008, so that when Mohamed Bouazizi immolated himself on December 17 2010, union members immediately organized support demonstrations after uprisings in sidi Bouzid where Bouazizi lived. A lawyers sit-in on December 25, a lawyers general strike on January 6, and a general strike on January 14 which brought down ben-ali. 

This is in contrast with the ETUF, which sided with Mubarak and not the protests against him. The independent trade unions in Egypt formed the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EFITU), and in march of 2011 demanded the dissolution of the ETUF. A rival independent union federation, the Democratic Labour Congress, also formed. 

Once Mubarak was gone the subsequent rulers were no friends to labour. The supreme council of the armed forces (SCAF), ruling from feb 2011 to June 2012, and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) did not pass new trade union laws. The SCAF criminalized protests that disrupted work. The military government that took over after Morsi in July 2013 was ousted made involvement in strikes something you could be imprisoned for. 

Morsi’s government tried to use the same corporatist methods of controlling labour. The minister of manpower was an FJP member (in a cabinet where few were FJP members, emphasizing the importance Morsi put on controlling labour) and FJP members were added to the ETUF board (which under Morsi’s decree no. 97, are appointed by the minister of manpower. The same decree forced those over 60, remnants of the Mubarak regime, to be removed). They were ousted after Morsi was. In addition:

> Also, the FJP put forward a draft law on labor unions that would have prohibited the establishment of new professional unions, preserved the structure of centralized decision-making within the ETUF, and made it difficult for workers to leave the ETUF without risking losing their access to social funds. The close connection between ETUF membership and access to these funds poses significant obstacles for the emergence of independent unions. ^4 

In Tunisia, independent trade union federations were formed after Ben-ali fell, often with former UGTT members as founders, and with criticisms of the UGTT, such as claims of corruption. The UGTT was not severely challenged by these independent trade unions the way the ETUF was. In addition to superior financial resources and larger membership, its history of relative independence gave it greater credibility than the ETUF. After Ben-ali, new union federations were legalized, but, as before, only the UGTT could participate in tripartite negotiations. (In Egypt no regular practice of tripartite negotiations exist.) 

The UGTT also played a mediating role, to try and mitigate the political crises after ben-ali’s ouster. It is able to take on this role because of it’s political clout, organizational strength, and history of militancy. That last factor is in part because the lack of political pluralism in the past has led to activists relying on the UGTT as a vehicle for human rights and general freedom struggles, making the UGTT a sort of umbrella organization. 

The UGTT’s role as a mediator sometimes led to them deprioritizing labour struggles, such as in November of 2013 when negotiations by workers on temporary contracts demanding permanent contracts were delayed because UGTT central leadership was not able to attend the negotiations. It’s role as mediator has also mitigated internal reforms over issues such as “internal corruption, the underrepresentation of women in the organization’s leadership positions, issues of internal democracy, and membership expansion.” ^4

It is noteworthy that the islamist party, Ennhada, often had an antagonistic relationship with the UGTT, warning that the UGTT would become partisan players by siding with leftist political parties, and criticizing it for its reliance on street mobilization for pressuring the government. 

In Tunisia, for various reasons, the democratic revolution was not undone, even after the political deadlock that took place after the Ennhada party formed government in 2011, which was succeeded by a caretaker government taking over in 2013 until new elections were held in 2014, when Ennhada joined the opposition. As mentioned before, this was partly because the UGTT played the role of mediator (along with other civil society organizations, the Tunisian Association of Human Rights, the Lawyers’ Association, and the Tunisian Union of Industry, Commerce, and Traditional Crafts.)

The political deadlock in Egypt, on the other hand, led to a military coup and the return of military dictatorship. As for what this meant for labour, “By 2013 a total of 1,000 independent trade unions had sprung up. In 2012 3,817 labour incidents were reported, a fourfold increase since 2007.” ^1 In addition:

> In Egypt, all independent unions were dissolved in March 2018 and given 60 days to reregister their organisation based on new arbitrary requirements established in Law no. 213/2017 on Trade Unions. Out of 1,000 independent unions, only 122 were able to successfully register their status under the new law and within the timeframe. ^5

Tunisia,working in Tunisia,Advice Needed: Starting a Tech Startup in Tunisia While Working with Foreign Clients,"**Hello friends!**

  
I'm looking for advice on starting a small tech company in Tunisia while working with foreign clients. I've done some research but haven’t found a clear path, especially since I’m new to Tunisian business laws and regulations, and they seem pretty complex.

Here’s my situation:

* **Current Status:** I’m working as a freelancer but not officially registered, so I don’t have any government declarations or an official freelancer status.
* **Projects and Payments:** I work on both local and international projects. For local payments, I use traditional bank/post services, but for foreign payments, I've been using a friend's account. However, I’m expecting a big increase in foreign income soon, which I’m worried will raise questions with the government. I have a formal consulting contract with this new client, so I want to legitimize things on my end.
* **Goals:** I'd like to start my own official tech startup in Tunisia. Ideally, this would help manage my finances, protect me legally, and allow me to keep working with foreign clients smoothly.

**Questions:**

1. Has anyone here set up a business in Tunisia while working with international clients?
2. What are the legal requirements to start a company, and are there any specific structures (like SARL, SAS, etc.) that work well for tech startups?
3. Any tips on opening a business bank account to receive foreign payments directly?

I’m currently facing a tough situation with my employer in Tunisia. I want to quit my job due to poor working conditions and very low pay, but my employer is not allowing me to resign or leave. I’ve already submitted my resignation with a two-week notice as per my contract, but HR has completely ignored it. They’re refusing to let me go or give me my *solde tout compte* unless I finish all ongoing projects, which would take more than another month.

I feel trapped and frustrated, as the work environment has become unbearable. I’ve spent 9 years of my life trying to build a career in this job, but sadly, it feels like all my efforts have been in vain.

* What are my legal rights in Tunisia as a Tunisian employee facing this situation?
* Can I sue my employer for preventing me from resigning or for the poor working conditions?
* What steps should I take before pursuing legal action?
* Are there any government bodies or labor organizations that can help me?

I'm a web developer and I want to start working on upwork, but I want it to be legal, or at least as legal as it can be so I don't get in trouble since freelancing is illegal in our great country .. I have multiple questions ..

First of all, is it impossible to declare that you work on upwork ? If it's possible, how and where should I go ?

If it's not (which is what I heard), since upwork can send directly to a local bank, before declaring my work, can I send small amounts of money or they would instantly know that the money is from upwork ? I know that large amounts of money would get me into trouble, but what about smaller amounts ?

And if I want to make it legal, should I create a ""SUARL"" or just a ""patente"" ? and what is the difference exactly ? why would someone create a ""SUARL"" if just getting a TIN is enough ?

And when declaring, what should I tell them that I do ? should I make something up ? is there a proof of work that I should get ? if so how can I get one if I'm not working ?

And where exactly should I go to declare a ""patente"" or a ""SUARL"" ?

And if I declare, can I send whatever amount of money or they would investigate for big amounts ? meaning is declaring better but not perfect ? should I always be careful to not let them know that I work in upwork ?

And thank you so much guys, I’d appreciate any advice or help!","1 - no it's not possible  
2 - they always know it's from upwork they just let small amounts slide, well technically small amounts won't cause you any issue but you don't know it's better to play it safe  
3 - every  company (Societe) needs a ""patente"" and SUARL is a type of companies, basically for any kind of business you need a ""patente"", i'm not sure what's a TIN?  
4 - if you mean when you declare taxes to 9badha then just hire a good accountant he will take care of everything  
5 - i advise you to hire a good accountant, the process is very painful to do alone and an accountant will take care of everything for you and get you your papers ready  
6 - when you have a company you will have to provide an invoice for every transaction and it will usually take a couple of days to get your transaction processed, and they don't care if you work on upwork or in any other place as long as you're a company that pays its taxes

Tunisia,working in Tunisia,Seeking Advice on Tax Residency and Legal Implications of Working Remotely in Tunisia as a UAE LLC Owner,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working in the UAE and have my own LLC there. Recently, I started working remotely from Tunisia, and I plan to stay here for 8-10 months a year due to some family issues. As a UAE resident, I don’t have to pay any taxes in the UAE, but I do need to visit twice a year to maintain my residency.

My question is: Will staying in Tunisia for 10 months create any problems for me, especially at the airport when traveling or going back to the UAE? Also, do I need to pay taxes in Tunisia? If so, how do I go about it? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you recommend?

From what I understand, staying in Tunisia for more than 183 days would make me a tax resident here. I’ve also heard that the only time I might encounter issues is if I decide to buy a house, land, or a car otherwise I will be safe. Is that true?

Another option I have, though it's more complicated, involves the fact that there is no double taxation for dividends paid by a UAE company to a Tunisian resident as an investor. However, it’s illegal for Tunisian residents to own a company abroad. So, I’m considering maintaining my UAE residency, keeping my company there, and paying myself dividends in Tunisia at the end of the year while staying here almost year-round. 

I’m concerned that in order to maintain my UAE residency, I need to be employed by my own company as a manager, which could complicate things further in Tunisia.

I know this is complicated and not very clear, especially since the laws in Tunisia are unclear when it comes to uncommon situations like mine. Please share any thoughts or advice you may have. Any information would be truly appreciated. I want to avoid any legal issues, I don’t wanna do anything illegal and wanna stay safe.

(Please don’t suggest creating an LLC in Tunisia. I think paying 10% on dividends for tax, 19% VAT, 10% CNSS, and more for my salary is too much. That’s why I created my LLC in the UAE. My original plan was to stay there and in Asia as a digital nomad, but unfortunately, things changed, and family comes first.)

Thanks! ","I lived outside Tunisia (not in the UAE) for multiple years, and came back a little less than 10 years ago to work remotely.


To remain completely legal :
* You need to keep your foreign residency in order to be legally entitled to own foreign companies / banking, so you need to fulfill the yearly requirements to keep your residency active.
* As long as you have your residency, customs won’t bug you at any airport.
* **BUT** This is a completely different subject than taxation, if you spend more than 180 days in Tunisia at any given year, you become fiscal resident in Tunisia (Residency and fiscal residency are two different topics). Meaning that you need to pay taxes on your worldwide income in Tunisia no matter what the rules are where you’re doing business. So for example I know you don’t have taxes in foreign income in Dubai, but if are fiscal resident in Tunisia, you pay taxes at the Tunisian rates, and you have to report those benefits or you’ll be doing tax evasion like many knattreyya.


It’s overall straightforward, you fill your yearly requirements to maintain your residency in UAE this will make your situation clear with customs.

Tunisia,working in Tunisia,Remote work in Tunisia ,"If you're based in Tunisia and you find a full time remote job abroad, contract and all, how would you proceed when it comes to payment? Bank transfer? Payoneer? How about taxes? Would the government get involved? Is there anyone currently working remotely with a foreign company and is based in Tunisia, or knows any useful information about it? I know some people open a ''patente'' or what we know as batinda but that's expensive right? I'm a newbie who's super confused so any help would be appreciated. Thanks. ","No need to worry, it’s something very common and very legal.


First thing you need to understand what kind of work agreement would you have with your employer, is it a Contractor or Employee.


In both cases and depending on how much you will be earning, you’ll either use a “Patente” or a “SUARL”.


Patente costs almost nothing, a couple of paperwork to fill. SUARL will involve an accountant to get it right (and avoid circling between administrations) so it might cost you like 1000 TND to open.


To get paid, no need for Payoneer or any other foreign accounts (that’s illegal). You will head to your bank with your patente and work agreement and will ask for a compte PPR en devises (select the same currency as your employer will use). You share your IBAN with your employer and he transfers the money directly to Tunisia.
Every time you get a payment, save 20% of the amount. And once in a quarter go to the nearest Tax Office (Qbadha) fill some form and give them a check for that 20% you withheld.


If you think that 20% is too much, understand that employees at Tunisian companies get withholdings up to 37% so it’s really fair (and way less than other countries).


Don’t be afraid of the process and keep in mind that as much you follow the rules, none will bother you.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1dsk83l/remote_work_in_tunisia/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en

Tunisia,working in Tunisia,"I (F29) divorced my husband and gave him money to start his life, but now he’s threatening me.","Hi everyone,  

I’m writing this because I need advice, and my mind is spinning(ma3andich 7al ken eni nhabet l hne ). I’ve been in Australia for 5 years, building a life for myself. I was married to my childhood friend and later love, for 3 years. We’d known each other forever, and despite everything, I thought love was enough.  

When I moved here, I found out he cheated on me. His excuse? That I was ""too distant w rajel maynajemch yosber."" Even though I was hurt, I forgave him. I didn’t want to seem cruel or heartless by leaving him behind ( w manhezouch m3aya ), so I paid for everything his papers, flights , Visa , and our start in Australia. I thought we’d rebuild.  

For the first year and a half after he arrived, I worked tirelessly. I had two jobs working in an office by day and at a gas station at night. I paid all the bills, sent money to help my family back home, Paid the rent and made sure there was food on the table. Meanwhile, he sat at home doing nothing. He refused to look for work or contribute in any way ( walah nosref w n5arej w nlabes w ena kol chay nrawa7 nadhef w ntayeb w howa ra9ed w zyd t3alem chrab w ena contre).  

We had so many arguments about it. I was exhausted, physically and emotionally. Eventually, he started throwing his hands literally. He hit me multiple times during arguments, blaming me for his situation. He made me feel like it was my fault, and it truly is because am the one to blame because i brought him here wa7abestouch 3and 7adou w 9olt STOP m loul.  

But I couldn't take it anymore. Quietly, I filed for divorce here and back home. I didn’t tell him at first because I still wanted to help him. I felt guilty. He had no one else but me, and even after everything, I didn’t want to abandon him completely. I saved up and gave him $5,000 to start fresh. I even spoke to a friend and secured him a job that he refused. I also gave him notice to leave the house by January 1st.  

When I finally told him we were no longer married, he lost it. He accused me of cheating, called me horrible names, and threw a tantrum. Worst of all, he threatened to kill me if I ever left him.  

I’m scared. I have his threats recorded, and I’m planning to file a complaint with the police, but I feel like my world is collapsing. I tried so hard to be kind, to give him chances, to help him stand on his feet. Instead, I’m left feeling broken, afraid, and questioning myself.  

What did I do wrong? How did it come to this?  

Any advice would be appreciated. I don’t know what to do next.



Edit : Wow, I didn't expect my post to blow up like this! Thank you all for your advice and solutions, I truly appreciate the support. Just to clarify, it's currently summer in Australia, but I'm on vacation in Tunisia for a couple of weeks. I'll be back in Canberra in a few days. 

I've already spoken to his family and informed mine about the situation. A couple of my Australian friends are aware of everything as well, just in case something happens. Before leaving, I left him a note with the landlord, asking him to vacate the house before January 1st. Once I'm back in Australia, I plan to file a formal complaint against him.

To be honest, he wasn’t always like this (though the cheating was always a red flag). He used to worship me, but it seems his true colors showed when I brought him with me. I tried to help him, even secured him a job, but he didn’t want to change. Now, we’re officially divorced, and I’m proud of the decision. I have absolutely no regrets.""

Tunisia,working in Tunisia,Returning to Tunisia After 4 Years in Europe – Shocked by Relationship Dynamics,"After spending 5 years in Europe, I've recently returned to Tunisia, and I’m genuinely surprised by some of the mentalities here, especially around relationships and marriage finances. During my time in Europe, it was common for couples to split expenses 50/50, or at least share them proportionally, given that both partners typically work—and sometimes the woman even earns more than the man.

Here, however, there seems to be an expectation that the man covers all the financial responsibilities. I find it astonishing that it’s just accepted that a man handles 100% of the finances. Why would a woman want that? If you truly care for someone, shouldn't contributing equally, or at least trying your best, be natural? Relationships, especially marriage, should ideally be built on balance, right? One-sided financial pressure can complicate a man’s life, and I feel like sharing this burden is more aligned with mutual respect and partnership. Am I alone in thinking this?

Now, at 28, living for almost 2 years in the UK and working with an international world leader company in my field, I just don't feel myself and I'm  not willing to spend the rest of my life away from Tunisia. My only refuge here is my husband. You might start the ""we're trying to escape this hole"" thing, yes I know how bad the situation is in Tunisia, I know everything. But what I learned after losing my father 4 years ago, is that there are irreplaceable things, there are priorities..I just don't accept the idea of seeing my mother 2 times a year. That my beautiful nephew and niece who were born in front of my eyes are growing older and I'm missing their childhood. I just hate the fact that my family is not gathered (I have a sister settled in Norway too)..the idea of not being able to gather whenever I want with my family and friends is just so heartbreaking. You might think I'm emotional but I'm just appreciating the value of my loved ones, and honesty nothing feels like Tunisia (a cliché but yes to me it is). Ps I used to love rainy and grey weather but now I'm just desperate for sun.. My only plan here is to finish these 5 years and the moment I get an indefinite leave to remain or a citizenship I'll immediately go back to Tunisia, that's the hope I'm living for. Your experiences please.. Thanks","Get the passport first, save some money to invest trade or look for a remote position and go back.

I (M29) wasn’t born in Tunisia and did that for couple of years before I embarked on a journey around the Mediterranean. Sicily, Spanish Islands, Greek Islands and Northern Morocco.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Moving to tunisia,My dad wants us to move to Tunisia but I have never been there so I am curious what it’s like to live there. Are people really religious ? Is it normal for me to go to street without hijab? Is the arabic they speak very different than classic arabic (fus7a) what is school like? ,"If possible, I suggest you come as a tourist for a couple of days. See things for yourself, the people, lifestyles, cities, prices, behaviours, their sense of fashion etc. You can also watch videos on Youtube of foreigners who live in Tunisia or came as tourists.

Keep in mind that it also depends on where you decide to live.


> Are people really religious ?

On average, I'd say not really. They usually mind their own business anyway.



> Is it normal for me to go to street without hijab?

I live in Tunis and the majority of women are without hijab.


> Is the arabic they speak very different than classic arabic (fus7a)

It is based on classic Arabic but has many French loanwords, some Latin influences (Italian, Spanish..), a bit of Ottoman Turkish, and of course Amazigh (historically our native language). You can watch videos on Youtube of people speaking Tunisian in order to introduce yourself to the dialect.
Many people and especially younger ones (millennials and gen Z) are good with English.

I’m Tunisian but born and raised in northern Europe, never lived in Tunisia. I’m married to a Tunisian and we are waiting for my partner’s residence permit to be approved which sadly can take anything from 6 months to years. 

I have always wanted to leave Northern Europe as I never felt home here, I absolutely hate living here and have hated it for as long as I can remember. Culture, climate, lifestyle, all of it just isn’t my thing at all. It was always my goal to move away from here to ideally somewhere around the Mediterranean.

Has anyone here left the corporate world behind or just relocated from Europe/the west to Tunisia?

Your only goal is to minimise the damage done to you. You have to survive and you do not get to live.

La Tunisie can be unlocked once you hit the 5k tnd a month as a single man or 10k tnd per month as a family.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,If given good financial/job opportunity: A Tunisian conservative would move to liberal secular Canada.

Tunisia should just allow **freedom of religion** while limiting security threats and maintaining public order. Our priority is to address economical issues and pollution.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Need to move to Tunisia ASAP,"Hey y'all,  I just want to know what the living situation is in Tunisia, I've been watching videos on YouTube and stuff but can't get an exact answer yet, especially when looking for a place to rent.

I had googled the least expensive place to live in Africa and Tunisia popped up, apparently $400 usd can cover rent and living expenses in Tunisia, like rent was $110 usd, this is probably false but would super appreciate any first hand experience anyone could give!","400USD can easily get you a nice apartment to live in on your own - if you find a shared place with roommates, you can find a crappy room for as low as 200TND (65$) or probably something solid in a good area for about double that. So the estimate you've seen is pretty accurate, unless you get ripped off or rent on Airbnb (which tbh is not unlikely lol).

The situation is ok, in terms of safety Tunisia's very safe, save the occasional pickpocket. Especially if you're coming from the US (which idk, but assuming given your reliance on USD). Economically things are a bit tough right now, but I think the situation tends to be exaggerated a bit... People talk about there being no coffee, bread, sugar, other staples but it's not really accurate. Cafés everywhere still serve coffee all day, though prices rose a bit (currently you can expect between 1.3 and 2TND or $40-65c for an espresso), and supermarkets have mostly run out of local coffee but still sell imported coffee, which in turn is quite expensive (think 8-10USD for a glass of instant coffee). Milk is everywhere. Subsidized white sugar is tough to come by, but supermarkets all have more expensive alternatives which (not to minimize how painful this is to regular Tunisians), for you coming in with foreign currency, is not gonna be a huge deal. You can also get bread in your neighborhood bakery most days, however, it's not abundant like it used to be. In conclusion, the economy is bad but as a foreigner with (presumably) a good bit of foreign currency and purchasing power at the moment, the situation is very manageable **BUT** things are looking unclear for the near future and this may change...

Also beware that while most staples for living a simple life and sustaining yourself are really cheap in Tunisia for someone coming in with USD, there are certain things that are basically the same prices as in Europe or the US. This definitely includes electronics, kitchen appliances, cars and many international food and snack brands. You'll find a local chocolate bar for $40c in the supermarket next to a Snickers bar (and that only in very few places) for $3. I would also say that electricity consumption is relatively expensive here. Also cars are more expensive here than in most of the world... And be aware that there are many things you may be used to from the US that you simply can't get here, like certain brands, certain fruits and vegetables or staples belonging to certain cuisines (like East Asian, South Asian or Latin American foodstuffs).

Going out is very cheap - street food style places you can expect 5-7TND for a meal ($1.5-2.3) or as low as 2TND ($65c) for a sandwich or wrap, and fancy restaurants you'd expect a main to be 20-30TND ($6-10) or a bit more... Alcohol is also quite cheap, especially local beer which bars will sell for as low as 4TND per bottle ($1.25), but the fancier places up to 8-9TND ($2.50-3). Beware that as for the street food, it's bound to give you some stomach issues here and there, especially in the summer when it's very hot, so beware and I'd recommend cooking yourself through the hottest months of the year.

I am hesitant to fully believe what my government is saying though, as they are very biased against Islamic countries and tend to say this about all of them. I have spent a lot of time in Egypt and found it to be very safe, even though my government said the same warnings about Egypt as well.

I am hoping to hear from local people's perspectives about the safety in your country. Would it be foolish to move there?

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,"I (F29) divorced my husband and gave him money to start his life, but now he’s threatening me.","Hi everyone,  

I’m writing this because I need advice, and my mind is spinning(ma3andich 7al ken eni nhabet l hne ). I’ve been in Australia for 5 years, building a life for myself. I was married to my childhood friend and later love, for 3 years. We’d known each other forever, and despite everything, I thought love was enough.  

When I moved here, I found out he cheated on me. His excuse? That I was ""too distant w rajel maynajemch yosber."" Even though I was hurt, I forgave him. I didn’t want to seem cruel or heartless by leaving him behind ( w manhezouch m3aya ), so I paid for everything his papers, flights , Visa , and our start in Australia. I thought we’d rebuild.  

For the first year and a half after he arrived, I worked tirelessly. I had two jobs working in an office by day and at a gas station at night. I paid all the bills, sent money to help my family back home, Paid the rent and made sure there was food on the table. Meanwhile, he sat at home doing nothing. He refused to look for work or contribute in any way ( walah nosref w n5arej w nlabes w ena kol chay nrawa7 nadhef w ntayeb w howa ra9ed w zyd t3alem chrab w ena contre).  

We had so many arguments about it. I was exhausted, physically and emotionally. Eventually, he started throwing his hands literally. He hit me multiple times during arguments, blaming me for his situation. He made me feel like it was my fault, and it truly is because am the one to blame because i brought him here wa7abestouch 3and 7adou w 9olt STOP m loul.  

But I couldn't take it anymore. Quietly, I filed for divorce here and back home. I didn’t tell him at first because I still wanted to help him. I felt guilty. He had no one else but me, and even after everything, I didn’t want to abandon him completely. I saved up and gave him $5,000 to start fresh. I even spoke to a friend and secured him a job that he refused. I also gave him notice to leave the house by January 1st.  

When I finally told him we were no longer married, he lost it. He accused me of cheating, called me horrible names, and threw a tantrum. Worst of all, he threatened to kill me if I ever left him.  

I’m scared. I have his threats recorded, and I’m planning to file a complaint with the police, but I feel like my world is collapsing. I tried so hard to be kind, to give him chances, to help him stand on his feet. Instead, I’m left feeling broken, afraid, and questioning myself.  

What did I do wrong? How did it come to this?  

Any advice would be appreciated. I don’t know what to do next.



Edit : Wow, I didn't expect my post to blow up like this! Thank you all for your advice and solutions, I truly appreciate the support. Just to clarify, it's currently summer in Australia, but I'm on vacation in Tunisia for a couple of weeks. I'll be back in Canberra in a few days. 

I've already spoken to his family and informed mine about the situation. A couple of my Australian friends are aware of everything as well, just in case something happens. Before leaving, I left him a note with the landlord, asking him to vacate the house before January 1st. Once I'm back in Australia, I plan to file a formal complaint against him.

To be honest, he wasn’t always like this (though the cheating was always a red flag). He used to worship me, but it seems his true colors showed when I brought him with me. I tried to help him, even secured him a job, but he didn’t want to change. Now, we’re officially divorced, and I’m proud of the decision. I have absolutely no regrets.""

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Algerian looking to move permanently to Tunisia,"Hello neighbors!

Any tips you have for a 23 yo who is looking to move to tunisia? I don't have a degree but I do work online (remote software engineer).

I get paid in euros, in Algeria I have to sell those in the black market (sells for 33% higher then converting currency in the bank). Is this a thing in Tunisia as well?

How can I legally declare my activity as a remote worker? and would that grant me long term residency?

How much is rent for a small apartment? And how much do you need to live comfortably in Tunisia?

Thanks!","I guess you can't open your own company in Algeria until you finish conscription, right?

&#x200B;

  
Turkey will be perfect for you: all online income is exempt from taxes up to $75k/year then 10% auto deducted. You don't have to do anything the bank takes care of your taxes and everything. All you need to do is prove you are a remote worker and they will let you stay.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,"swedish mom and tunisian dad, why is he this way?","Hi! i'm 18f, and me and my family moved to Tunisia for about 4 years ago. We honestly hoped to leave an islamophobic environment and move on and live a happy life in a muslim country with family and nice people. Unfortunately as soon as we came here everything fell apart. Our family is slowly falling apart as every day goes by.

I knew my dad had anger issues and other mental health issues since he was treated really badly as a child. I know his parents and uncles was horrible to him, never showing him any love or making him feel loved. He was constantly beaten and grew up really poor. He hasn't really said anything about his mental health, but i think we all know that something is wrong.

He was better before, but here in tunisia he has gotten a thousand times worse. I look back at old photos and i see how he has changed. He is constantly stressed out, everything here has to be done by paper and it's not as quick and simple to do things like it was back in Sweden. I think we all expected that, but not to this extent. People are constantly calling him, people are never being serious here and money is everything on their minds. I'm obviously not saying everyone is this way, but this is what he has told me. He says he's sad and dissappointed how Tunisia has changed. He had a totally different view of what it would be to live here before, but now we all regret coming here. I honestly sometimes get more looks here then back in sweden for wearing hijab at my age. It's pretty embarassing to also see people casually buying products like coke, pringles, and other products that not even arab or muslim people are trying to boycott to not pay israel.

My dad is constantly busy and has the worst mood swings. We used to be very very close and i used to see him as my best friend. But recently i honestly feel hate being around him. He treats me and my family really horrible, then acts like nothing happened the next day. He goes from calling me pretty and beautiful to randomly telling me how selfish i am and always complaining about everything i do. I always try to act a certain way around him, i don't use my phone at all when he's around, i don't talk to friends on the phone when he's around, i basically just clean and cook and other chores around the home. I feel like i turned into a maid, unable to go out or communicate with people, i'm not allowed to have my own life or go out by myself. I am extremely depressed and i miss being able to walk to school and have friends and just doing things by myself. He has to get angry at least once every day. My mom is being very patient and is always trying to convince him to go seek help or a therapist, but he thinks we are accusing him of being ""crazy"". We used to be a happy family but now we all are on our own, being depressed and worrying about the next day. I used to be longing to sleep and wake up the next day, but now i hope i sleep and don't wake up. I'm seriously tired of life and cannot see myself continue living this way for the rest of my life. We cannot move back due to personal issues, but also because we have spent all our money to have a nice home and lifestyle here in tunisia. I don't speak arabic or french, and i have difficulties learning since i don't have any friends here or cannot communicate with anyone.

I'm wondering if this is because he was raised this way, and cannot change. Or is it because we moved here and everything just got worse. My mom is really trying to make him change, but he is just taking everything out on me, my siblings and my mom.","**displaced aggression**

**he couldnt defend himself in the past and his old wounds never healed**

most people  dont want to admit they  were wrong its a toxic trait .

he feels that he is losing control so he tries to control his family for a need of power.

more and more his feelings of resentement will grow with age .

sadly my dear this will eventually make u hate and resent him .

or destroy him and his family

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Dating a Tunisian woman as a non-Tunisian man. Are there any potential cultural barriers?,"I'm a 28 year old Asian man and I recently started seeing a 27 year old Tunisian woman (we matched on Hinge). She's from Tunisia but moved to Asia for university when she was 18 and has stayed here ever since. I found out during the first date that she was Muslim, which she hadn't disclosed on her profile. She mentioned that she observes Ramadan but doesn't go to the mosque, so I'm not exactly sure how strict she is about her faith. She also drinks but doesn't eat pork. We've been on 2 dates so far and we get along really well together and seem to have shared goals and values (Except the religion part). 

Culturally we both speak perfect English (I went to school in the US, and she learned English growing up in Tunisia). She also is really in tune with Asian culture because she watched a lot of Chinese and Japanese films growing up, and also studied Asian languages at university. So she can actually speak my language semi-fluently which I find really attractive. And we're also physically attracted to each other of course. However, I'm not religious at all, and I don't know if this will cause problems in the future. I'm curious what Tunisian women's general attitudes towards dating non-Muslim men are. And how likely is it that we would run into issues, such as her not being willing to marry a non-Muslim, or being ashamed/hiding me from her family, etc.? I don't want to bring these issues up yet since it's so early on, but I'll definitely discuss them with her if we make it past the 4th or 5th date. But I wanted to get some third-party opinions first!","Tunisians women are usually open minded but in your case if you open up to her and tell her that there is no way your kids would grow up to be muslim + you want intimacy before marriage, you are getting rejected guaranteed. You only have been on 2 dates go try something else, and let her find someone that will strengthen her faith and not consider raising his kids muslim a nightmare, and even though she doesnt go the mosque, it doesnt mean her faith in allah (and islam) isnt that strong, as long as she believes in god she can become more religeous at any point you never know, and for the intimacy thing, ask her directly and i hope she says no because in our culture and religion (and every other aspect) women and men shouldnt sleep around not even once before marriage.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1gvgs3m/dating_a_tunisian_woman_as_a_nontunisian_man_are/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Got a 100% scolarship in Malaysia.Should I go?,"I got a 100% scolarship in a chinese university based in Malaysia called Xiamen University Malaysia that's ranked 364th worldwide(for reference it only opened its doors 8 years ago) and 49th in Asia.

I will list the pros and cons that I have found so far and help me decide


Pros:

1/As long as I'm in the top 35% of my class, I would not have to pay the tuition fees(19000dt)


2/Everything's the same price or even lower compared to Tunisia and especially PC parts(300/400Dt lower with a lot more offers to choose from)

3/Campus is big and has a lot of facilities including Basketball and swimming which I do like

4/Dual Accreditation in the sense that I get a Malaysian and Chinese degree

5/Would be a chance to learn how to live on my own/rely on myself since I would be far away from my parents

6/Rent is cheap( the dorm is 200DT but it's only compulsory to stay in it for a year and then one can move out)

Cons:

1/Far away place and this isn't a complaint for me but my parents have expressed concerns since I would  rarely be able to visit

( doesn't help that we only get 2.5/3 months of vacation, 1.5 months in August and a month in January, this is for the undergraduate programm and I haven't been able to find schedules for specific domains nor did I find the time tables)

2/I'm afraid that if I don't end up in the 35% in my class,I would have to come back to Tunisia and be unemployed or go private since I don't think public tunisian schools offer equivalence degrees and I don't think private unis give scolarships to students who sign up a year after they passed the baccalaureat 

(My parents said they're fine with paying 19000 DT a year on top of the living expenses which are not accounted for in the scolarship but I'm personally not ok with that)

3/Weather is a major downgrade from Tunisia

4/I would literally have to decide in the  next 2 days since I would have to confirm soon to the agency I'm going with so that they can start the visa process( I have to be in Malaysia the 5th of September) and if that were so I wouldn't be able to go any public school and filling the tawjih page would be useless 

5/They drive on the left lane and I don't have a driver's licence so doing one here wouldn't be useful if I end up moving out 

6/I'm not sure if either a Malaysian or Chinese degree are useful on the international scale

7/From posts I've seen, the main demographic of the students in the uni are Chinese/Malaysians of Chinese ethnicities with a minority of Africans and middle easterners so I think it would be harder to socialize since everyone would be kept to their communities 


PS: I have a friend of mine who's going to the uni and already started the process so I wouldn't be completely alone",Dont even look back,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1dzvn5v/got_a_100_scolarship_in_malaysiashould_i_go/,"Unknown, Tunis",General,en

Wow what a great accomplishment totally meaningless when your country sucks and women and men are fleeing abroad ! 

He was a dictator who set Tunisia up for failure , he was bad dictator because he wasn’t visionary . He didn’t bother to plan for a stable political system after him, leaving the country in chaos m3a Ben Ali , Nahdha and Kais said. 

He ignored the need for real economic development  by failing to invest in manufacturing when things were easy back then compared to today. Till today cha3b tounsi is consumer and produce nothing other than some agricultural goods and then they complain why BCT doesn’t allow paypal : if they do , you will literally become the next Lebanon with dinar value tanking because we import almost all technology and manufactured goods like cars .

Worse, he let the system keep exporting workers to help build France not Tunisia . Till today Tunisians dream is to work abroad , even if you are an engineer or doctor working abroad, you are still somehow slave to that country just like coal miners and masons back then. 
Bourguiba clung to the French colonial system, a proven failure compared to more successful models like the American one, keeping Tunisia stuck in the past.

And let’s not forget his short-sighted rejection of uniting Tunisia with Libya—a move that could’ve given Tunisians access to Libya’s oil wealth. There we’re basically not that much libians back than less than 2 million if im not wrong . It was basically an offer to share all that oil with Tunisians brain . 

Countries poorer than Tunisia like Singapore and South Korea and Taiwan were transforming themselves into global powerhouses thanks to their visionary leaders .

There we’re basically not that much libians back than less than 2 million if im not wrong . It was basically an offer to share all that oil with Tunisians brain .

You know Gaddafi appointed himself as minister of defense? You know what that means? There is no union, both Libya and Algeria wanted to absorb Tunisia it's no secret, both tried and failed.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,What did the Ottomans leave us ?,"I am doing a little research on our history out of curiosity. Trying to understand the current state of Tunisia and what led to its state.

Taking a look, a very abstract image was concluded from how each country in North Africa, the Middle east and the Balkans, all part of the Ottoman empire back in the days.

Turkey is standing on its feet, 5th strongest country in Turkey as Erdogan calls it. Istanbul is full of fancy mosques, built by gold or whatever, tombs made of gold for the Sultans and their wives, mistresses and sons..It has its own share of problems too, but we can't argue that it's miles ahead of every single land it once occupied when it was an empire.

That reminds of me of France, with its fancy capital, Paris, built when France was importing most of its funds, labors and money from African countries they conquered.

Going through the internet, and in Syrian and Egyptians threads and asking, and also watching the famous Youtuber 'Dahih', the Mamaliks episodes.. Egypt's weakening as a strong nation started from the end of the Mamaliks, by the hands of Selim 1, the famous greedy Ottoman ruler.

""Ottomans entering Egypt was Similar to Mongols entering Baghdad"" -- quoted from a historian 'Dahih' mentioned in the video.

.. it's not about military, but about the foundation, infrastructure, etc... All Ottomans did was build barracks and fortresses and walls, no hospitals, no dams, no schools... same was stated by a few Syrians I talked with in Reddit. And they are the closest neighbors to Turkey. 

From the looks of it, it was the basic empire ruling : ""Make them pay taxes, strengthen our military, recruit more troops ' the famous Janissaries system ' and expand more our empire"" As they clearly didn't get two shits about Islam, so why they engaged with Egypt and Safavids, who were already muslim kingdoms ? I think of course there are other factors, but I do believe the first one was simply greed. And one of the roots of the current splits within the Arab world could be because of he way Ottoman sultans ruled and not deciding to form genuine alliances with Arabs and North Africans.

Let's look away from the middle east and North Africa and take a look at the Balkans.. they are slightly better, but far worse than western Europe. Now first, again, I'm not blaming everything on the Ottoman empire but I'm looking and searching.. Balkans are in a mess because of the Yugoslavian war, but things aren't looking good, and again, checking out their foundation as nations, it's not that promising. Ottoman empire has a very bad reputation there too, even in Busnia ( again from the very few stuff I checked on the internet ).

Now my question is, I might be missing something, but first of all fuck the French colonists, but they did build hospitals, bridges ( I'm from Bizerte and the moving bridge, the school I studied in, the hospital where I was born, were all built by French ).. but did the Ottomans leave us anything similar, like anything infrastructure related or something ? Hence, we have might have more heritage from the Caliphate time than the Ottomans...

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,"Content and happy in Tunisia, even though I could move abroad am I the only one?","I'm a Tunisian freelancer, and I'm content and happy living here, even though I could move abroad.

Of course, Tunisia has its challenges. The living standards have decreased in recent years, the economy is suffering, and there are a lot of problems. But I believe that every country has its challenges.

I'm an introvert, and I enjoy the lifestyle in Tunisia (and anywhere in the world for that matter) I can still save money and travel, and most of the activities and things I want to do are doable here. I also make a very good living freelancing, and taxes are a lot lower than in countries like Canada, Germany, or France, which are popular destinations for Tunisian emigrants.

I'm also happy with the weather in Tunisia, the nature, and lots of other things. I think no place on earth is perfect, and Tunisia is not that bad.

I'm writing this post to ask people if they are content and happy even though they did not leave their country.

* Are you content and happy in Tunisia, even though you could move abroad?
* Why or why not?
* What are some of the benefits of staying here?
* What are some of the challenges of staying here?

If you disagree with me please feel free to share your thoughts (politely) I am always keen on hearing opposite sides. 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!","صحة ليك خويا، القناعة كنز لا يفنى، و السعادة اختيار.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,Will it be very hard for me to date in Tunisia as an East Asian man?,"I know the question sounds ridiculous, but my friend just received lucrative job offers from some countries including Tunisia, Jordan and is considering moving to either Tunisia or Jordan in December of this year, he invited me to go there as well, we did some research and talked about the culture and dating in general, both of us are handsome, East Asian and gets the ladies well in East Asian countries.  

I was wondering, as a male of East Asian descent, do I have a shot in the dating scene in Arab countries like Tunisia ? I just want to know, because i heard it is very difficult for East Asian men to date in western countries like USA Canada UK Australia Germany France etc. Would u say Tunisia is similar to the aforementioned western countries in that regards? Also, keep in mind not all East Asian men are Chinese from China so dont automatically assume all East Asian looking people are Chinese. There are several other East Asians such as Japanese, Korean, Thai, Filipino, etc.  

In terms of looks, I would say I am above average. I know that there's more to dating than looks, but first impressions and people can just look at someone see if they're into them or not, any insight would be appreciated.  

Anyways, I am wondering if the average Tunisian women thinks East Asians are uglier or wouldn't date them for some reason, or if it doesn't matter. From what I've heard, East Asian men are considered very unattractive for vast majority of women outside of East Asian countries so I assume I will have a very hard time dating girls in Tunisia.  

Is it the same for Tunisian women when it comes to their opinions on East Asian men? (Curious)  

Hope my question isn't offensive. Shukran.",it's okay as a tunisian i can't get tunisian women either,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1fulcie/will_it_be_very_hard_for_me_to_date_in_tunisia_as/,"Tunis, Tunis",General,en
Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,To Tunisians Abroad: What Do You Think About Life Back Home?,"For those of you who've moved abroad, found success, and earn a comfortable income—how does it feel when you look back at the situation in Tunisia? Many people here consider a salary of 1.5K TND decent, and 3K TND is seen as pretty good, even though it’s barely enough for long-term goals like owning a house or a car.

How do you feel about friends and family staying in Tunisia, knowing they may never experience the same opportunities you’ve had? What do you think when you see people settling for what’s possible here, maybe without seeing what could be out there?

This isn’t meant to judge anyone or look down on anyone’s lifestyle—just hoping to understand different perspectives on how things look from the other side.","*I do not live abroad* but my best friend is and we had this conversation (H is him) (qm is me)

M- well it would be nice if you can afford buying a house there, it's cheaper than rent.

H- yes, but it will bit of a troublesome to resell it, cause tbh with you, I don't want to live here.

M- Bro you thinking of coming back here? It's a shit show.

H- yes, but I always feel lonely, I only visit twice a year, I can see the wrinkles on my mother's face and my father becoming older and older, I always feel alone, even Tunisian who live there act as it they are from there, no identity, nothing authentic about them, even sbah khir and 3la khir they don't say it....I love how neat everything is how most services are near perfect, no littering, no noise, no pollution....but it simply does not feel like I belong there, and they are racist, they act normal around me till they know I'm a Tunisian and a Muslim (he could easily pass as a German or west European, tall, blond...), they are racist even if they never admit it.

Tunisia,moving to Tunisia,"Tunisians living abroad, how is life ?","My question is mainly for those who have been living abroad for more than 4 years, People who just recently moved are probably still adjusting or feeling the excitement of the new experience.


Which country are you living in, and would you say you're happy there? Have you managed to build your own social circle, or have you settled into a routine on your own? If you're married, did you bring your partner from Tunisia, or did you meet them abroad? If you're not married, is there a particular reason why?


Lastly, what kind of hobbies or activities do you engage in outside of work? Or has work become your main focus?
